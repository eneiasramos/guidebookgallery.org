This paper documents some of the most interesting aspects of Apple II user 
interfaces. Included are both graphical and text-based interfaces that have 
noticeably been made under various contexts and stages of development on the Apple 
IIe/IIc by both Apple Computer and third party developers, whilst showing the standardized 
user interface of the Apple IIGS, which heavily borrows from the classic Macintosh.
</p><p>
Regrettably, GEOS and Apple II Pascal are not included in this presentation. GEOS 
proved to be difficult to run adequately due to configuration problems, and Apple 
II Pascal is simply absent from my software library. I hope you enjoy these nostalgic 
screenshots, along with the commentary alongside them illustrating why these interfaces are 
important to note.

Text-based user interfaces of the Apple II
</p><p>
Back in the days when there was no room for graphical user interfaces in a personal 
computer, people wrote programs using a text display (what else was there?!). But 
regardless of what display mode was used to present information, the information 
was indeed <i>presented</i> in some kind of stylistic fashion. Early Apple II system software 
programs exhibited this trait in the apparent design of the computer software with the 
intent that the software was less intimidating and easier to understand for the user. 
To explain why this was the case, it had to be realised that DOS 3.2 was the first 
Disk Operating System for the Disk II floppy disk drive &ndash; prior to that was 
the cassette interface and the Integer BASIC command-line prompt!
</p><p>
Whether the specifics of the user interface design were intentional or just simply because 
of one product manager&rsquo;s ideas of how (s)he wanted Apple II system software programs 
to look, the early DOS System Master and the ProDOS User&rsquo;s Disk tools for the 
Apple II Plus and first-generation 64K Apple IIe did have a distinctive &ldquo;look and 
feel&rdquo; about them, even though you could argue that the design was minimalist, 
bordering on uninspiring. These system programs had two things in common where user 
interface design was concerned: they produced a menu that was single-key activated, 
and they produced a banner identifying the program in use or the current location 
in the menu hierarchy.
</p><p>
The DOS 3.2 System Master&rsquo;s File Developer program (affectionately known as FID) was 
probably where this so-called Apple II user interface style started. You can see in 
the following screen shots the distinctive asterisk-style boxes reminiscent of how 
Assembly and C programmers write comments in their source code, and the full-screen menus. 
No other kinds of programs adopted this style; only Apple system programs that managed 
computer files and disks did.

The design was implemented so that the banner was always present indicating where you 
were in a program, while the content region was pretty much unstructured with content 
as the program saw fit to display. Even as ProDOS became the new operating system 
standard for the Apple II, the use of asterisks and uppercase text in its design was 
probably just the consequence of accommodating ProDOS on the Apple II Plus, which 
did not have lowercase text or an 80-column text display. It continued throughout most 
of ProDOS 1.0's life span until the Apple II Plus was no longer supported with the 
release of ProDOS version 1.2.
</p><p>
One system program that did run on the Apple II Plus and offered a more stylish (yet 
simplistic) design was the ProDOS Conversion Kit. You will see the significance of this 
interface later in this article.
</p><p>

</p><p>
On an Apple II Plus, the program was smart enough to use all-uppercase text for 
its display. The asterisks were replaced with minus characters, which reduced the 
on-screen clutter and busyness of the asterisk character. The display was partitioned 
into three sections... the header, the body (or content), and the footer. The design 
intent of the user interface became apparent when the Apple II drew to its display, 
because the content region actually scrolled to fit more text whilst the header and 
footer regions remained static and preserved regardless of the results of an operation.
</p><p>
On the departure of the Apple II Plus, and with the introduction of the Apple IIc and 
Enhanced Apple IIe, which supported 80-column text, 128K of memory as standard, 
and an extension to the Apple II&rsquo;s ASCII character set called MouseText, versions 
of the Apple II system software with a more formal appearance started using more stylish 
and functional user interface designs, using more arrow keys and highlighting and less 
single-key menus. However, with the realisation that hitting arrow keys could 
be tedious to the user, it was made so that hitting a letter key on the keyboard would 
select a command starting with that letter (but not actually invoke it).

AppleWorks for the Apple IIe and IIc also used MouseText in order to implement its 
folder-oriented user interface display. It also started showing signs of some of 
the standard user interface elements seen in today&rsquo;s graphical user interfaces... 
particularly the progress bar, seen here as AppleWorks starts up. Admittedly, 
this appeared at about the same time as the Macintosh, so it was not like the Apple 
II was used as a user interface prototyping platform for the Macintosh or something! 
But the fact that the Apple II text display was used to illustrate graphical feedback 
controls was indeed an interesting aspect of user interface design on an Apple II.

suggesting that there was an effort for AppleWorks to remain functional on those 
Apple IIe computers that didn&rsquo;t support MouseText (original 64K Apple IIe 
computers that were upgraded to 128K, but not with the Enhanced Apple IIe ROMs). 
But again, like the ProDOS Conversion Kit, the three-region text display and 
user interface style remained as a formal user interface design for text-based 
Apple II applications from Apple.
</p><p>
AppleWorks became the first text-based user interface to adopt a standard user 
interface template that was mimicked by other Apple II applications developed by 
Apple and third parties. The Apple II System Disk for the Apple IIe and IIc 
also adopted the folder-oriented user interface soon after the release of AppleWorks.

To the Apple II enthusiast like myself, one could notice the absence of MouseText 
on this display (AppleWorks&rsquo; folders look cleaner with completely formed lines, 
which could only be done with the aid of MouseText). This was probably done again to 
support the original 64K Apple IIe.

Apple II graphical user interfaces
</p><p>
The first Apple II program to use a mouse and implement some sort of graphical user 
interface was MousePaint. The program was featured on the Apple II ProDOS User&rsquo;s 
Disk, and on a separate disk that came with the Apple IIe Mouse Card.

</p><p>
MousePaint was an Apple II implementation of the popular Macintosh application 
MacPaint. MousePaint&rsquo;s user interface was not as advanced &ndash; there were no 
keyboard shortcuts to menu commands, and the menu commands were rather confusing and 
difficult to understand at first (it took a while for users to understand what 
the command &ldquo;Put a copy in...&rdquo; actually meant &ndash; on the Macintosh, 
this would be the &ldquo;Save As...&rdquo; command). MousePaint was a stand-alone 
program &ndash; it did not support any other software and only relied on the 
ProDOS operating system for disk operations like opening and saving files. Also, 
MousePaint only knew how to print to an ImageWriter or to a Scribe printer &ndash; 
no other printers were supported.
</p><p>
If there is one comment to make about MousePaint, it&rsquo;s that for a graphically 
intensive Apple II application, even on a 64K Apple IIe (which ran at 1 MHz), the 
user interface was surprisingly responsive. The mouse was remarkably smooth, and 
scrolling around the pixel canvas was seemingly effortless. Menus also appeared 
instantaneously, with no noticable drawing lag. Yet, MousePaint did not have many 
things to animate &ndash; only the menu bar was the most obviously &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; 
user interface component to manage.
</p><p>
There were at least two other Apple II applications that implemented graphical user 
interfaces. MouseCalc was an application by International Solutions, Inc., which operated 
the Apple IIe&rsquo;s Double-High-Resolution graphics mode to implement an 80-column 
display with built-in embedded spreadsheet graphics. The program used the mouse to 
operate it, but the interface did not resemble that of a traditional desktop &ndash; it 
was more like a graphically enabled AppleWorks with an on-screen pointer (the display 
was ugly, mostly black with white text, and resembled that what you&rsquo;d probably expect 
to see on an IBM PC).
</p><p>
Another more convincing desktop-like application for the Apple IIe and IIc was 
BeagleWrite by Beagle Brothers (also known as MultiScribe before Beagle Brothers took 
the product over), which was a rather sophisticated (for its time) word processing 
application that actually implemented some of the typical ruler-based formatting 
features, and built-in desk accessories, although they did not allow BeagleWrite to 
actually work alongside the accessories like on a Macintosh.

</p><p>
BeagleWrite&rsquo;s user interface permitted the use of the keyboard to control 
the program entirely (no mouse required), but at the cost of not being as intuitive as 
it could be for both the mouse or the keyboard user. Additionally, notice the 
keyboard shortcuts... with the distinct lack of user interface guidelines, keyboard 
shortcuts often did not agree with those of other applications. Keyboard shortcuts 
were also available for controls that would not otherwise be expected to have one, 
such as buttons.
</p><p>
The Apple IIe and IIc did not get a graphically oriented system disk, although the 
256K Apple IIGS did. MouseDesk was the Apple IIGS&rsquo;s first desktop shell, and 
it provided most of what Apple II users would ever want out of a system utility, 
while showing a glimpse of the future of the Apple IIGS.

The Apple IIGS was pretty much introduced to potential users in black-and-white. 
MouseDesk, and the first Tour of the Apple IIGS, were applications that used the 
Apple II&rsquo;s Double-High-Resolution graphics mode in black-and-white, and 
ran under 8-bit 6502 emulation mode! While it was enough to do basic filesystem 
maintenance and start both ProDOS 8- and ProDOS 16-based programs, it took Apple 
over a year (and more hardware updates) to release something as a desktop shell 
that resembled much more of what the Apple IIGS could have been.
</p><p>
MouseDesk&rsquo;s user interface was rather awkward to use, because of flaws 
in the user interface implementation. While it looked like Macintosh, it was far 
from it. Menu commands had shortcuts which one could never guess, and some 
commands were cryptic and difficult to use, because of the direct use of traditional 
Apple II idioms like &ldquo;slot and drive&rdquo; specifications or &ldquo;ProDOS 
block sizes,&rdquo; or because of simply the poor implementation of user interface 
controls and behaviours. One thing I noticed about the interface was that it ignored 
the user&rsquo;s current selection for some commands, forcing users to re-specify what 
it was they want a command to act on. Other commands were implemented as separate 
programs, causing MouseDesk to quit and start another application, resulting in 
MouseDesk forgetting all about what state it was in when it returned to the user&rsquo;s 
desktop after completion of the secondary command. And like some other Apple 
II programs that appeared to have desk accessories, MouseDesk&rsquo;s desk accessories 
overtook the entire desktop, preventing the user to perform other tasks whilst 
an accessory was open.

To demonstrate how incomplete MouseDesk was as a system utility...

...this was provided for those special moments when MouseDesk was not up to 
the task, mostly due to bugs! Doesn&rsquo;t this look familiar?! This was included on 
the MouseDesk floppy disk. Notice how this software was renamed &ldquo;Apple IIGS 
System Utilities&rdquo;!
</p><p>
Incidentally, it was possible to get MouseDesk to run on an 128K Apple IIe or IIc, 
being an 8-bit Apple II program, but it actually took a bit of work to pry MouseDesk 
off of its 800K floppy disk, because of how MouseDesk was organised as being a shell 
program for ProDOS 16, and because parts of MouseDesk had to be discarded to make 
it fit on a 140K floppy disk for those systems not featuring a 3.5&rdquo; UniDisk drive!
</p><p>
The Apple IIGS Finder made its appearance about two years after the release of the 
Apple IIGS. And when it did make its appearance, it elevated the Apple II desktop to 
the sophistication of the Macintosh SE (where the system software was concerned). The 
first versions of the Finder exploited the 65C816 processor and the 16-bit Apple IIGS 
Toolbox (based in concept on the original Macintosh Toolbox), improving the capacity 
and the stability of the system, while allowing the Apple IIGS to take advantage of 
its memory capacity and its new graphics capabilities. However, the first incarnations 
of the Apple IIGS Finder were plagued with performance problems, mostly due to 
deficiencies in the Apple IIGS Toolbox. 
</p><p>
As Apple released updates to the Apple IIGS system software, some of these performance 
problems dissipated &ndash; the latest and last Apple IIGS system software release 
(System Software 6.0.1) performed desktop graphics operations 3-5 times faster than 
the original Apple IIGS Finder (System Software 3.0) without changing the hardware, 
except for perhaps a 1 MB memory upgrade. The last incarnation of the IIGS Finder 
presented a rather clean, easy-to-understand and familiar interface for those who 
have used Macintosh. And for those who haven&rsquo;t used Macintosh... well... it 
served as a darn good equivalent, with some impressive bridging technologies made 
available to allow Apple IIGS computers to fit in within a Macintosh world.

Two of the most important Apple IIGS applications (apart from all those games!), 
were AppleWorks GS and HyperCard. Both applications showcased the power of the Apple 
IIGS system software &ndash; in some cases, it even excelled its Macintosh counterparts.
</p><p>
AppleWorks GS provided compatibility with data files from the original AppleWorks (for 
the classic Apple II), with new graphics capabilities. Some parts of AppleWorks GS 
are reminiscent of some of the applications that appeared on the Macintosh (such as 
MacTerminal and MacWrite). It is apparent here that the Apple IIGS Toolbox implemented 
most of the original Macintosh controls &ndash; menus, buttons, scrollbars and thumbs, 
and window titles. Coupled with nearly a 2:3 aspect ratio for every pixel on the display, 
and a restricted vertical resolution of a mere 200 lines, the Apple IIGS had a much 
harder job in rendering the Macintosh desktop user interface, particularly radio buttons, 
where circles were not drawn as perfect circles! Fortunately for the less-powerful 
machine, user interface objects were pre-rendered in later system software releases, 
which meant the consumption of more memory space, with the disadvantage that controls 
were not resizable.

HyperCard GS was another application that took an originally Macintosh application into

the Apple IIGS, had a larger screen size to implement much sharper high resolution monochrome 
graphics with larger card sizes. Nevertheless, HyperCard GS was a window-less 
application, and exploited the entire desktop to implement its cards.

So far, all Apple IIGS screenshots have used the Super-High-Resolution 640 mode, 
most often used by applications that did not rely on the extensive use of colour. 
However, the Apple IIGS Toolbox also supported the desktop in Super-High-Resolution 
320 mode, which probably looked rather strange and &ndash; due to the severe restriction in 
screen real-estate &ndash; not as practical in implementing Apple&rsquo;s graphical 
user interface. Notice the window sizes of desk accessories... they all tended to 
be taller than they were wider. That was because they had to be no wider than half 
of a 640-wide display, simply so that they could be fully contained within a 320-wide one!

</p><p>
On the left screenshot, BeagleDraw, a program that resembled MacDraw for the Macintosh, 
is buried underneath those desk accessories... somewhere! Find File was one example of 
the rather serious restrictions imposed on desk accessories due to the nature of 
the Apple IIGS&rsquo;s display, and the inherent need to support the lowest common 
denominator of Apple IIGS features. And often, Apple IIGS programs made demanding use of 
the display&rsquo;s colour palettes (there were only 16 colours assignable per scan 
line), which often caused some user interface features, particularly desk accessories, 
to look weird.
</p><p>
BeagleDraw took another step in making the Super-High-Resolution 320 mode work &ndash; 
it used Geneva 9 bold as the system font rather than the default system font, 
Shaston 8 (used here in the labels for the bars in the mock-up bar chart). Obviously, 
Shaston 8&rsquo;s character width was significantly wider than that of Geneva 9, 
and considering BeagleDraw had already taken up all of the screen width for its menu bar, 
it was obvious why the developers could not stick to the standard Apple IIGS system font 
to implement its menus!
</p><p>
I have purposely tried to limit this discussion to Apple II system software and applications 
by Apple Computer, because usually, the company that makes the system is the one 
that establishes the guidelines for writing software for that system. And Apple 
have evidently applied user interface, or at least, ease-of-use, guidelines to 
their software for both text and graphics environments since almost the very start 
of the Apple II&rsquo;s career into personal computing. The inclusion of some of 
the more interesting third-party applications that adopted a graphical user interface 
has been made in contrast to what had become Apple&rsquo;s standard user interface design 
for both the Apple II and the Macintosh.
</p><p>
While today&rsquo;s user interface designs and concepts are much more sophisticated than 
the ones older computers had to deal with or implement, it is interesting how developers 
dealt with various problems in user interface design, especially on an Apple II. The 
Apple II has been an interesting architecture to study, because it was literally a 
very limited piece of hardware that had to live up to the expectations from a company 
that produced Macintosh.
