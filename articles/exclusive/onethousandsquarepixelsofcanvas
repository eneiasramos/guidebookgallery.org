On evolution of icons in graphical interfaces
</p>
<p class=comment>
The article describes the background and the detailed history of computer 
icons featured in graphical interfaces &ndash; complete with visual examples 
and short descriptions of 21 interfaces (from 1981&rsquo;s Xerox Star to 
upcoming BeOS Zeta). There is also a breakdown of various icon properties 
(such as size, style or number of colours). The article ends with a 
quick glimpse into the future and a conclusion that the icons are not 
necessarily evolving into the most desirable direction, focusing more on the 
visuals than the functionality.
</p><p class=comment>
Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not very happy with this article. It is not well-researched, and
generally written in a hurry. Still, I can imagine it might be somewhat useful?

Introduction
</p><p>
We have pretty much grown accustomed to icons omnipresent on our computer screens, 
PDAs, and mobile phones. As with all things that are second nature, we don&rsquo;t 
really think much about how the icons started, how matured, and in which ways 
are modern icons different than their 20-year older counterparts.
</p><p>
However, such journey through time might help us rediscover the very essence and 
true purpose of icons &ndash; something that seems to have gotten lost during 
all the technological advancements.
</p><p>
This article aspires to be such a journey. It will begin with a short introduction 
to the background of computer icons. Then a historical trip will follow, starting 
with 1981&rsquo;s Xerox Star, and finishing in 2003 with the still unreleased 
BeOS Zeta. The breakdown of various icon properties (size, style, orientation, 
etc.) comes next, and the article will end with a short speculation on things to come.

1. The beginnings
</p><p>
Historically, an icon is an artistic representation or symbol of something holy 
and divine, in form of relief, painting or mosaic, usually quite small in 
size. [1] The word itself comes from Greek <i>eikon,</i> meaning simply &ldquo;image.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In today&rsquo;s language, an icon describes a symbol, face or picture representing 
some well-known attribute, entity or concept. Icon should be readily recognizable, 
even if usually only within a given cultural environment. Examples of famous icons 
are: hammer and sickle (standing for former USSR), Swastika (Nazi), balance/scale 
(justice), tulips (the Netherlands) or lightbulb (an idea).
</p><p>
In computer science, an icon is a small graphic representing a file, directory, 
application or a device of a given computer system. 
</p><p>
Computer icons as we know them today appeared first in the 1970s at the legendary 
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center laboratories. They were part of so called &ldquo;desktop 
metaphor,&rdquo; which presented the computer system as a virtual desktop, 
trying to make use of people&rsquo;s natural reactions and associations with using 
their desks, sheets of papers, folders, the trashcan, etc.
</p><p>
The years of work of Xerox PARC laboratory were finalized in Xerox 8010 Information 
System, which, alas, was a commercial failure. However, Apple picked up on 
the idea and after launching the rather unsuccessful Lisa, finally popularized 
icon-driven interface with their 1984&rsquo;s Macintosh.
</p><p>
Nowadays, the concept of an icon and all the gestures associated with it 
(clicking, double-clicking, selecting, dragging, etc.) seems natural for 
most of the computer users. However, being more or less tied to the progression 
of graphic hardware and software, the icons continue to evolve.

2. The evolution
</p><p>
Let&rsquo;s try to summarize and maybe even predict the next step of this 
evolution by looking back at the history of icons through the most 
important interfaces.
</p><p>
<br><table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right><tr><td align=left><img alt='Icons from Xerox Star (magazine scan)' title='Icons from Xerox Star (magazine scan)' src='pics/articles/onethousandsquarepixelsofcanvas/xeroxstar.png'></td></tr></table>
<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
2.1. Xerox Star (1981)
</p><p>
1981&rsquo;s Xerox Star&rsquo;s icons were black and white, with resolution 
of 72&times;72 (since the display had a density of 72 ppi, every icon occupied 
an exact square inch).
</p><p>
The icons were highly symbolic, based on rounded rectangles. They established 
conventions used to this day &ndash; a document was a blank sheet with one 
corner folded, a directory was a regular manila folder with a tab on top, 
the trashcan had sheets of paper inside it.
</p><p>
The consistency across all the icons, and the attention to detail was amazing. 
Inbox and outbox icons showed an envelope whenever mail was unread or unsent. 
A clock icon was a regular working analog clock. An icon corresponding 
to an opened window was shown in outline, so the user would never see 
two instances of the same object. And, in a solution never seen later, the 
titles of icons were part of the icons themselves.
</p><p>

<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
2.2. Apple Lisa (1983)
</p><p>
Next in line was Lisa, Apple&rsquo;s ill-fated office computer. Lisa&rsquo;s 
desktop icons were somewhat similar to those of the Xerox Star Information 
System, although more detailed &ndash; the trashcan had ribs and a cover, calculator 
digits, etc.
</p><p>
The icons were also black and white, but of a slightly smaller resolution &ndash; 
48 pixels per 24 pixels. This was due to Lisa having lower screen resolution 
than Xerox Star, and also non-square pixels. 
</p><p>
<br><table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right><tr><td align=left><img alt='Icons from Macintosh System 1.1' title='Icons from Macintosh System 1.1' src='pics/articles/onethousandsquarepixelsofcanvas/macos1.png'></td></tr></table>
<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
2.3. Macintosh (1984)
</p><p>
Macintosh had even more interesting and unique icons. Designed by Susan Kare, they 
were much more than just a simple collection of black-and-white 32&times;32 pixels pictograms.
</p><p>
Macintosh icons were the first to bring a clear distinction between documents 
(paper sheets with folded corners) and applications (a human hand holding a tool 
against a sheet of paper). They also included several classics, such as &ldquo;happy 
Mac&rdquo; icon, the metal trashcan or the exclamation/question mark face.
</p><p>
The icons were instantly recognizable, consistent, well-balanced between concrete 
and abstract, and created with international users in mind (so an interim icon 
for copier featuring a cat in the mirror symbolizing &ldquo;copy cat&rdquo; was 
dropped [2]).

</p><p class=subcaption>
2.4. Windows 1.0 (1985)
</p><p>
Icons in the first edition of Windows, released in 1985, shared many 
characteristics of the program itself (of course, no one would dare to call 
it an operating system yet). They were ugly, non-functional, and seemed 
placeholders for better icons which for some reason failed to materialize.
</p><p>
Even though they used the very same 32&times;32 pixel grid and black and white 
colour scheme, they were far cry from subtlety and elegance of Macintosh 
icons. One could pick two of them at random and be almost sure that the 
orientation, the style or the shadows would be inconsistent. What&rsquo;s 
worse, despite there being just about a dozen of icons in the entire Windows, 
some of them were similar enough to be easily mistaken with each other, even 
when viewed side by side. For example, that was the case with icons for 
Control Panel and Calendar, both represented as rectangles divided 
into several pieces.
</p><p>
About the only gem in early Windows was the icon for Clock, itself being... 
a working analog clock, such as in Xerox Star. However, this interesting idea 
was dropped with the release of Windows 3.0 in 1990.
</p><p>

2.5. Amiga OS (1985)
</p><p>
It&rsquo;s hard to find someone who really thought highly of Amiga OS&rsquo;s icons, 
but no one could deny them uniqueness.
</p><p>
First editions of Amiga OS (then known as Workbench) used a distinctive palette of 
four colours (black, white, blue and orange). What really made them stand out, 
though, is that there was no arbitrary limit on icon size. Every icon could 
have different dimensions. And often had, contributing greatly to the chaotic 
nature of Amiga&rsquo;s interface.
</p><p>
What&rsquo;s more, icons had two states &ndash; selected and unselected. Icon just 
clicked on might have looked completely different than a second ago.

</p><p class=subcaption>
2.6. TOS (1985)
</p><p>
It is interesting how sometimes the icon design reflects the traits of not only 
the interface, but also the computer, and sometimes even the company behind it.
</p><p>
Amiga was always slightly disordered &ndash; the operating system, the GUI, 
the case design and many other aspects seemed like finished in a great hurry. 
Its arch-nemesis, Atari ST, was a completely different story. It had cute 
advertisements, toned-down case and compared to Workbench, almost boring GUI.
</p><p>
The icons of this GUI &ndash; the GEM-based TOS &ndash; were also clean and 
well-behaving, sitting quietly in black and white in their 32&times;32 squares.
</p><p>

<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
2.7. NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP (1989)
</p><p>
While both Apple and Microsoft were slowly refining their respective GUIs, 
another operating system was pushing the envelope much faster and further. It 
was NeXTSTEP, the object-oriented system, which later evolved into OPENSTEP.
</p><p>
NeXTSTEP&rsquo;s icons were bigger (drawn at 48&times;48 grid), shaded and more 
colourful. Even if they didn&rsquo;t represent one unified style, they were years 
ahead of other creations in terms of technological advance.
</p><p>
NeXTSTEP was initially monochrome, but later started supporting colour screens.

</p><p class=subcaption>
2.8. Windows 3.0 (1990)
</p><p>
While Microsoft put the hideous icons from Windows 1.0 also in the second 
edition of their soon-to-be flagship product, they wouldn&rsquo;t repeat that 
mistake again.
</p><p>
For Windows 3.0, Microsoft hired no other than Susan Kare herself, who added 
style and substance to the previously neglected icons. Still at 32&times;32, 
the icons now sported 16 colours, had consistent shadows and were 
vastly improved visually.

2.9. Macintosh System 7 (1991)
</p><p>
This time it seemed it was Macintosh system&rsquo;s turn to follow the lead 
of Microsoft Windows. Seventh release of Macintosh&rsquo;s GUI finally brought 
colour to icons (although the Macintosh supported colour output from the very 
beginning), supplemented by shading. 
</p><p>
The icons were coloured quite subtly, mostly in shades of gray with only 
touches of blue or yellow.
</p><p>

<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
2.10. Windows 3.1 (1992)
</p><p>
As many other interface elements, icons in Windows 3.1 were refined to 
include some simple shading (mostly around the edges), thus adding to their 
depth and making them look more realistic.
</p><p>
Some shadows have also been added.
</p><p>

</p><p class=subcaption>
2.11. OS/2 2.0 (1993)
</p><p>
IBM&rsquo;s OS/2 has always suffered from various identity crises. Its first 
version, produced in cooperation with Microsoft, was probably one of the 
most non-iconic GUIs ever. In turn, the third release (OS/2 Warp) went 
into 3D shading, and the fourth even flirted a little with an isometric 
Copland style (more on this later). However, it was the second edition which 
had most successful and distinctive icons.
</p><p>
They might have been simple, set on a classic 32&times;32 pixel grid and using 
only 16 colours. However, they had their common style, something that can&rsquo;t 
be said about any other OS/2 edition. Set in delicate grays and dirty greens, 
with touches of blue and yellow, they fitted the nature of the system rather 
well. They also have to be commended for a consistent use of shadows.
</p><p>

</p><p class=subcaption>
2.12. Copland/Mac OS 8 (1994-1997)
</p><p>
In 1997, after almost three years of demos and sneak-peaks, the eighth 
release of Macintosh operating system (in the meanwhile renamed &ldquo;Mac OS&rdquo;) 
brought a new style of icons. It was quickly dubbed &ldquo;Copland&rdquo; 
after the codename of the operating system (which itself was a homage to American 
composer Aaron Copland).
</p><p>
The &ldquo;Copland style&rdquo; refers to pseudo-3D icons, set on an isometric 
grid with about 26&deg; of slant. Isometry means lack of perspective &ndash; two 
parallel lines will never visually converge and meet in any point in 
isometric space. This style is often used to make manufacturing plans for viewing 
three dimensional objects in &ldquo;exploded&rdquo; views. [3]
</p><p>
New icons, further refined in Mac OS 8.5 (and updated with millions of colours 
instead of just 256), became very popular with Macintosh fans. They beautifully 
complemented the new Platinum appearance of Mac OS, were very well crafted 
and &ndash; again &ndash; unique.
</p><p>

<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
2.13. Windows 95 (1995)
</p><p>
Windows 95 also started using Copland-style isometric views in some areas, and 
most of the icons were redrawn for this probably most important Windows release to date.
</p><p>
The icons were still 32&times;32 in 16 colours, but accompanying release, Microsoft 
Plus! for Windows 95, allowed the people to use 256-colour icons.
</p><p>

</p><p class=subcaption>
2.14. BeOS (1997)
</p><p>
The icons in BeOS operating system were one of the best examples of unique 
graphical identity. BeOS&rsquo; icons were also isometric, but the grid was 
non-symmetric, with slants of 45&deg; (from the right) and ca. 30&deg; (from the left). 
</p><p>
This, along with unique and quickly recognizable colour scheme (revolving around 
various shades of brown, red, yellow and gray) provided a set of icons 
pleasant to look at, functional and... simply different.

2.15. IRIX Interactive Desktop (1998)
</p><p>
IRIX Interactive Desktop from SGI might be in the league of less known graphical 
interfaces, but it has a number of unique HCI features. One of these 
features are vector icons.
Granted, they are not very attractive (even if anti-aliased, which is possible in 
newer versions of the system), but can be scaled to any size without losing quality.
</p><p>
The icons are also consistent in their appearance, using a mirrored Copland 
look, casting shadows on the surface, and featuring &ldquo;magic carpet&rdquo; 
which differentiates running applications from those waiting to be executed. [4]

2.16. Rhapsody (1999)
</p><p>
Rhapsody was a short-lived operating system, a missing piece linking both 
classic Mac OS and NeXTSTEP and eventually evolving into Mac OS X. 
</p><p>
Rhapsody&rsquo;s icons were the last breath of the official Copland style 
(&ldquo;official,&rdquo; because Copland gathered a large fanbase of people 
still designing icons according to its principles). In most cases it was 
also the end of the original Macintosh style started 14 years earlier. But 
what a goodbye it was &ndash; icons were updated for new 48&times;48 resolution, 
had transparency mask and were enhanced with more colours and more subtle shading.
</p><p>
However, Rhapsody&rsquo;s interim status accounted for great deal of inconsistency 
in its icons-some of them still retained NeXTSTEP roots, while others were ported 
from Macintosh.

2.17. Amiga OS 3.5 (1999)
</p><p>
Released well after Amiga&rsquo;s &ldquo;imperial phase,&rdquo; the version 3.5 
of the operating system featured a completely new set of isometric icons. They 
were different mainly as being heavily dithered, but again presented an 
unique visual identity.
</p><p>
Most of the icons were sized 48&times;48, but they were usually surrounded 
by a large border.

</p><p class=subcaption>
2.18. Windows 2000 (2000)
</p><p>
In the meanwhile, Windows icons were slowly refined in every subsequent edition 
of the operating system, reaching climax in Windows 2000. 
</p><p>
By default still in 32&times;32, the new 48&times;48 mode was available upon 
request. The icons were mostly variations on the &ldquo;originals,&rdquo;

2.19. Mac OS X (2001)
</p><p>
Every previous Mac OS release had the icons drawn on a classic 32&times;32 
pixel grid, with the only significant change being the increasing number 
of colours (from two in System 1 to over 16 millions in Mac OS 8.5 and 9). 
However, 2001&rsquo;s Mac OS X brought the completely new, anti-aliased, 
semi-transparent Aqua interface, and that warranted a change of icon 
style as well. The change turned out to be a complete overhaul, as 
practically all the properties of the new icons was different. 
</p><p>
New icons were huge &ndash; 128&times;128 pixel grid was sixteen times as spacious 
as the one in previous versions of Mac OS. The icons were presented in 
24-bit depth with an 8-bit transparency mask. 
</p><p>
Gone were the pixels. Not literally, of course, but all of the icons had 
photorealistic style instead of symbolic one. To quote <a href='http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html'>Apple Human Interface 
Guidelines</a> <img width=10 height=8 align=baseline title='Link points to external site' alt='Link points to external site' src='intr/external.gif'>, <i>&ldquo;Aqua offers a new photo-illustrative icon style &ndash; 
it approaches the realism of photography, but uses the features of illustrations to 
convey a lot in a small space. Icons can be represented in 128&times;128 
pixels to allow ample room for detail. Anti-aliasing makes curves and 
nonrectilinear lines possible. Alpha channels and translucency allow for 
complex shading and dimensionality. All of these qualities pave the 
way for lush imagery that enables you to create vibrant icons that 
communicate in ways never before possible.&rdquo;</i> [5] The new icons 
also heavily featured transparency/translucency and shadows.
</p><p>
Icons were scaled automatically by system to smaller and bigger sizes. This 
was probably the first instance of this feature done correctly, which means 
that user was usually unable to distinguish between a big icon scaled down 
to, for example, 16&times;16 and the icon with this native resolution.
</p><p>
Mac OS X got rid of Copland look in favour of three different perspectives: 
application icons <i>&ldquo;sitting on a desk in front of user,&rdquo;</i> 
utility icons <i>&ldquo;standing on a shelf in front of user&rdquo;</i> 
and the toolbar icons featuring a classic &ldquo;straight-on&rdquo; perspective.
</p><p>
Many Mac users critiqued the bold move. The icons were simply too big, 
too colourful, too &ldquo;funky,&rdquo; leaving nothing to the imagination. 
The hard disk icon simply became... hard disk, even if not many people 
know how such a device actually looks like.

2.20. Windows XP (2001)
</p><p>
Microsoft&rsquo;s response to Mac OS X was Windows XP with its redesigned 
interface, unofficially called Luna.
</p><p>
Luna featured bigger and more colourful icons. The departure from the previous 
versions of Windows might not have been as big as in the case of Mac OS, 
but the difference was striking. The new icons were set on a 48&times;48 
pixel grid (more than two times bigger than Windows 2000), were presented in 
millions of colours, and provided 8-bit transparency.
</p><p>
But the most apparent difference was the visual style. Let&rsquo;s quote 
<a href='http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hwdev/windowsxp/downloads/default.mspx'>Windows XP Visual Guidelines</a>&rsquo; <img width=10 height=8 align=baseline title='Link points to external site' alt='Link points to external site' src='intr/external.gif'> rather informal introduction: <i>&ldquo;The 
Windows XP icon style is all about fun, color and energy. Windows XP 
icons include a 32-bit version that provides smooth edges &ndash; no more 
jaggies! Each icon is rendered in a vector program and then massaged in 
Photoshop to create a beautiful image.</i>
</p><p>
<i>&ldquo;(...) Characteristics of Windows XP-style icons: Color is rich 
and complementary to the Windows XP look. Angle and perspective provides a 
dynamic energy to the images. Edges and corners of elements are soft and 
slightly rounded. Light source is coming from the upper left-hand corner 
with the addition of an ambient light to illuminate other parts of the icon. 
The use of gradients provide dimension and give the icon a richer appearance. 
A drop shadow provides contrast and dimension. Outlines provide definition. 
Everyday objects have a more modern consumer look such as computers and devices.</i>
</p><p>
The icons also featured two views: angled perspective for bigger 
icons, and straight-on style for <i>&ldquo;document icons, icons that are symbols (such 
as warning or information icons) and icons that are not as recognizable at 
an angle or are single objects (such as the magnifying glass).&rdquo;</i> [7]
</p><p>
However, Windows XP seems to have fallen victim to what is knows as &ldquo;bigger, 
better, faster, more syndrome&rdquo; &ndash; even to a bigger degree than Mac 
OS X. Quite ironically, history went full circle. Just as in the case of 
Windows 1.0, it is very hard to distinguish among rows of similarly-looking bluish 
slanted shapes. Especially when the icons are viewed scaled down.

2.21. BeOS Zeta (2003)
</p><p>
Latest installment in BeOS family &ndash; BeOS Zeta &ndash; arrived with icons 
trying to cover the technological gap while remaining true to the 
original BeOS spirit.
</p><p>
The icons were quite successfully redrawn in 64&times;64 grid, along with 
necessary shading and drop shadows. However, quadrupling the size resulted in 
visual &ldquo;bulkiness&rdquo; of many of the icons. Furthermore, some 
of them are still hard to distinguish from each other &ndash; try to open 
Control Panel and look at Fax, Mouse, Network and Printers icons.

3. Properties
</p><p>
Having listed more than twenty most important icon sets in graphical interfaces, 
let&rsquo;s try to classify them along various axes.
</p><p>
<br><table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right><tr><td align=left><img alt='Icons from Mac OS 7, Rhapsody DR2 and Mac OS X Jaguar' title='Icons from Mac OS 7, Rhapsody DR2 and Mac OS X Jaguar' src='pics/articles/onethousandsquarepixelsofcanvas/size.png'></td></tr></table>
<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
3.1. Size
</p><p>
Since the emergence of WIMP-based GUIs, most of them have used the standard 32&times;32 
pixel grid, giving 1024 pixels. There were some exceptions &ndash; NeXTSTEP used 
48&times;48 pixel grid, and Amiga OS gave designers free choice when it came 
to icon size (which, quite expectedly, &lsquo;caused more harm than good). The 
latter is also a rare example of icons drawn with non-square pixels; Amiga&rsquo;s 
default resolution of 640&times;256 had pixels twice as high as wide. (The similar 
case is Apple Lisa with its 720&times;364 resolution on a regular 4:3 screen.)
</p><p>
Last years have seen the designers slowly breaking out of the 1024-pixel barrier. 
Mac OS X pushed the envelope to 128&times;128 and Windows XP&rsquo;s default icon 
resolution is 64ž64. Other popular desktop GUIs followed (GNOME is a good 
example, supporting icon sizes of up to 96&times;96 pixels [6]), and the 
previews of Longhorn&rsquo;s upcoming new interface hint at even bigger image 
sizes. All of these GUIs, however, still recommend to supply icons at 
smaller resolutions. This is done for two reasons-backward compatibility, and 
the fact that scaling down the big icons usually results in more detail 
loss than using predesigned small icons. [5]
</p><p>
Quite obviously, the physical size of icons has increased slightly less, due 
to the fact that new displays have significantly bigger pixel density than 
the old ones. For example, the original Xerox Star and Macintosh displays 
had density of 72 ppi, while the new LCD screens come with density of 
120-130 ppi. The 300 ppi displays have already been announced and are 
produced in small quantities &ndash; on such a screen, Mac OS X&rsquo;s icons will 
be of the same physical size as the 32&times;32 icons on regular displays.
</p><p>
It is also worth noting that sizes as small as 16&times;16 and 24&times;24 are 
still in everyday use even in modern operating systems (for example, in 
list or report views).
</p><p class=subcaption>
3.2. Type
</p><p>
The holy battle between raster and vector technology has been experienced by 
possibly every designer. First method represents images using a grid of 
pixels, the second one describes them by set of vectors. Both have their 
pros and cons, which can be found in any self-respected introduction to graphics. 
</p><p>
As we already learned, most of GUIs used pixels for representing icons, 
as they gave the designers more control over finest details. About the only 
interface with vector icons was the rather unpopular IRIX Interactive Desktop.
</p><p>
However, as the high-density displays are likely to become popular in the 
following years, but the low-density screens are also here to stay, it 
might be feasible for the GUIs to move towards vectors for their icons 
designs. This solution would remove the burden of creating various sizes for 
one icon, and ensure compatibility with every possible screen density. The 
other advantages might include easier icon transformation (adding slant 
or resizing), easier adding of visual effects (such as shadows), no 
need for creating mask, etc. Anti-aliasing and other techniques would ensure 
looks on par with the current raster icons (as has already been done with 
TrueType fonts, for example).
</p><p>
Windows XP Visual Guidelines already hint at vector origins of Windows 
XP icons, with the suggestion of creating the icons in vector-drawing software, 
and then porting them to Photoshop [7]. Similarly, just a quick glimpse 
at BeOS Zeta&rsquo;s or KDE&rsquo;s icons is enough to realize that with 
bigger sizes, it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense anymore to create the icon pixel by pixel.

<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
3.3. Number of colours
</p><p>
This property was probably the one with the most stable and expected evolution. 
First GUIs shipped with 1-bit depth, allowing for only two colours (usually black 
and white). With graphic capabilities getting more and more advanced, icons 
moved to 4-bit depth (16 colours), then to 8-bit (256 colours). It is hard 
to think of any instance of 16-bit icons, and the next step, 24-bit depth, 
was also the last one &ndash; 16.8 millions of colours are much more 
than the human eye can distinguish.
</p><p class=subcaption>
3.4. Transparency
</p><p>
Transparency began to play a bigger role only with latest editions of GUIs, 
providing 8-bit masks for icons. However, one has yet to see it used in 
a way that actually adds to functionality of a respective icon.
</p><p>
<br><table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right><tr><td align=left><img alt='Icons from Windows 95, BeOS Zeta, Windows 3.1, Windows 1.0 and Windows XP' title='Icons from Windows 95, BeOS Zeta, Windows 3.1, Windows 1.0 and Windows XP' src='pics/articles/onethousandsquarepixelsofcanvas/orientation.png'></td></tr></table>
<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
3.5. Orientation
</p><p>
Since the &ldquo;invention&rdquo; of Copland style (and even earlier, considering that 
even some of the Macintosh icons depart from the usual &ldquo;straight-on&rdquo; 
perspective) we&rsquo;ve seen many various pseudo-3D views: Copland, inverted 
Copland, BeOS, Windows XP, or one of Mac OS X&rsquo;s perspectives. Some of them 
are justified, other seem there just for the sake of it.
</p><p>
This property is probably where the worst inconsistencies appear. Windows XP 
has only two official &ldquo;icon views,&rdquo; but nevertheless manages 
to mix them all over the system (just look at your C:\Windows directory). Mac 
OS X is slightly better in this regard, but also not perfect.
</p><p class=subcaption>
3.6. Shadows
</p><p>
Proliferation of semi-3D views, as well as the introduction of transparency, 
prompted the addition of shadows to icons.
</p><p>
Fortunately, modern shadows are much more discrete and subtle, and in 
effect stand out less than the older black or gray outlines.
</p><p>
<br><table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right><tr><td align=left><img alt='Icons from three versions of Mac OS, Rhapsody and Mac OS X' title='Icons from three versions of Mac OS, Rhapsody and Mac OS X' src='pics/articles/onethousandsquarepixelsofcanvas/style.png'></td></tr></table>
<br clear=all>
</p><p class=subcaption>
3.7. Style
</p><p>
We end this list with a property which should probably be mentioned at the 
very beginning &ndash; the style of icons.
</p><p>
First icons were highly symbolic, which probably was the result of rather 
sparse visual means that were supposed to convey the ideas. Then the style 
evolved into more colourful drawings, balancing between &ldquo;abstraction and 
a tactile feel.&rdquo; [8] 
</p><p>
Lately, the appearance shifted to (photo)realism, and the question of &ldquo;we 
obviously can do it, but should we?&rdquo; became more and more valid. 
Datawise, every Mac OS X&rsquo;s icon is 512 times as rich as the original 
Macintosh icon. However, is it really 512 times as meaningful? At small 
sizes, it seems almost the opposite, as every icon looks just like a 
colourful blob, or &ldquo;a little smear.&rdquo; [9]

4. The future
</p><p>
Whether we want it or not, icons are here to stay. While the icon-driven graphical user 
interfaces might have (or will soon have) reached the end of their evolutionary 
road, there is still nothing better in sight. Besides, the icons themselves already 
proved useful in many other situations (for example as pictograms) and are very 
likely to stay on our screens regardless of any changes in metaphors or paradigms.
</p><p>
Sadly, the icons seem to evolve only in technogical sense, which sometimes &ndash; 
as in aforementioned case of Windows XP &ndash; might lead to mixed results. 
However, there is still much to be discovered in icons.
</p><p>
The concept of dynamic icons &ndash; that is icons changing appearance depending on 
the properties of object they represent &ndash; still promises great 
possibilities. There are already many examples: badges in Mac OS X, iCal icon 
showing the current date, or Windows XP&rsquo;s picture thumbnails. However, 
there are many more useful features which could be developed. Some of them 
were outlined by interface guru Bruce Tognazzini in <a href='http://www.asktog.com/columns/035SquanAdv.html'>his 2000&rsquo;s article</a>. <img width=10 height=8 align=baseline title='Link points to external site' alt='Link points to external site' src='intr/external.gif'> 
[10] Dynamic icons seem especially promising when coupled with vector icons, 
which seem inevitable considering the expected outbreak of high-density displays.
</p><p>
Another forgotten possibility is animation. Not just animation as pure 
eye-candy, but one that actually serves some purpose. For example, as 
a response to hovering over it with a mouse, or any different action. Some 
of the operating systems already include some simple animations when emptying the 
trash can, but there are obviously many more possibilities.

Conclusion
</p><p>
Most of us heard the expression that a picture is worth thousand words. And 
that was exactly the original idea behind icons in computer interfaces.
</p><p>
The icons in modern Graphical User Interfaces are still used more or less in the 
same way as twenty years ago. They are clicked or double-clicked on, moved and 
occassionally dragged. Being part of desktop metaphor, they are here to make our 
lives easier.
</p><p>
On the other hand &ndash; as we have noticed in previous sections &ndash; 
the visual appearance of icons does not stand still. In fact, if we 
forget about the functionality, it is usually hard to find many similarities between 
modern icons and their counterparts from the beginning of 1980s.
</p><p>
Naturally, this might be considered a natural side effect of evolution of 
hardware. However, looking at the latest graphically rich interfaces such 
as Windows XP or Mac OS X, it is clear that the icons have been slightly 
too &ldquo;overdesigned.&rdquo; Sometimes, instead of helping, they 
start to stand in the way.
</p><p>
Hopefully, future icons will be a little bit toned down and once again return 
to doing what they have always been supposed to do &ndash; enhancing the user experience. 
</p><p>
Keep that in mind when designing one.
