The Macintosh desktop environment was designed to make working on a personal computer 
easier and more productive. And the key to working in that environment is the mouse. 
This little, handheld device puts you in control of all the Mac&rsquo;s unique features.

The juxtaposition of a mouse and a computer on a modern office desktop or your cozy 
office at home might seem strange indeed. Is it some kind of marriage between high 
technology and the rodent population, or an example of the arcane Silicon Valley 
sense of humor?
</p><p>
Actually the mouse is not new to computers. It has been around since the early 1960s 
when Douglas Engelbart, an associate at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), created a 
small, mouse-shaped device with three protruding control buttons that looked like ears 
and a cable connecting the device to the main unit of the computer that looked 
like a mouse tail. Engelbart&rsquo;s objective was to design interactive computer 
aids that made using the machine more natural and less alienating.
</p><p>
Basically, the mouse works as a combination cursor-movement and all-purpose function 
key that allows you to operate a computer independent of the keyboard. With the 
Macintosh mouse, for example, you slide the device over a smooth surface with your 
hand, and the graphic pointer on the screen precisely follows its movement. A single 
button on top of the mouse allows you to select information or objects and 
activate commands. Essentially, the keyboard is a supplement to the mouse in 
the Macintosh desktop environment.
</p><p class=caption>
The desktop mouse
</p><p>
Most people&rsquo;s first reaction to the mouse or even the idea of a mouse-driven 
menu system is skepticism; they are leery of the mouse and cannot conceive of a 
computer without the noble keyboard and the familiar alphabet, numerals, and other symbols 
engraved on the keytops. No creature from the lower end of the evolutionary tree 
(or a mechanized gimmick) can replace the human intelligence embodied in a typewriterlike 
machine.
</p><p>
But after you spend a few minutes moving the mouse around and performing simple 
operations on a computer like the Mac, the thought of a standard cursor and the 
familiar keyboard seems less appealing. At first you may have problems coordinating 
your hand and eyes as you move the mouse and simultaneously watch the pointer 
move on the screen. You may end up playing &ldquo;chicken&rdquo; with the mouse and 
the end of your desk as you try to figure out how to reach the topmost cell 
of a worksheet without sliding the mouse off the desk (just pick up the mouse and 
try again, and you&rsquo;ll get your bearings). But after a few hours, you&rsquo;ll 
feel like an expert as you edit a letter or work on your budget with newfound 
ease and speed.
</p><p>
Using a mouse draws on an innate human skill: pointing. It&rsquo;s as natural as 
throwing a ball, but more importantly, it increases your productivity and frees 
you from the constraints of the keyboard. Because the mouse minimizes use of 
the keyboard, you can concentrate on what&rsquo;s happening on the screen, and you 
won&rsquo;t have to memorize or look up all sorts of keyboard command codes to 
do your work. For tasks that don&rsquo;t require extensive typing, a mouse in the 
hand is an efficient device.
</p><p class=caption>
Mouse lingo
</p><p>
As with other practical tools, specific terms are used to describe the actions of 
a mouse. Initially, you will focus on <i>sliding</i> the mouse on the desktop. However, 
once you get accustomed to working with the mouse, your reference point will be the 
screen. Rather than concentrating on sliding the mouse, you&rsquo;ll be thinking in 
terms of selecting or <i>dragging</i> objects on the screen; if you press and 
hold down the mouse button when the pointer is over an icon, you can drag the icon 
to a new location. <i>Clicking</i> (pressing and releasing) the mouse button selects 
a location within a document or activates an object.
</p><p>
<i>Double-clicking</i> (pressing and releasing the mouse button twice in rapid 
succession) is a shortcut method you&rsquo;ll quickly master; for example, instead 
of selecting an icon and then moving the pointer to the File menu to choose a command, 
you can double-click the mouse button in most instances. This action cuts down on the 
amount of mouse movement and the number of steps you need to complete certain tasks.

The plastic casing of the mouse hides a rather sophisticated piece of technology. If 
you look at the bottom of the mouse, you&rsquo;ll see a small rubber-encased steel tracking 
ball surrounded by a circular ring. When you slide the mouse across a desk, 
the ball mechanically stimulates two orthogonal shafts that drive signals in two 
corresponding channels: an x channel that monitors horizontal movement, and a 
y channel that monitors vertical movement.
</p><p>
The movement of the mouse is initially detected by optical sensors on each channel. 
There are two light-emitting sources and two light-detecting sensors for each channel. 
An optical wheel at the end of each shaft has slots, or apertures, in the optical signal 
paths. When the wheel rotates, it breaks and releases the beams of infrared light. 
The optical signals are in turn converted to electrical <i>quadrature</i> signals 
<i>(x1, x2, y1, y2)</i> by means of the sensors. These electrical pulses generate interrupts 
in the computer. Depending on the status of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> quadrature 
signals, the interrupt handler will either increment or decrement the <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> locations in memory.
</p><p>
The computer picks up the speed of the mouse by the number of times the infrared beam 
is broken or unbroken. The maximum speed that you can move the mouse without losing pulses 
(interrupt signals) is ten inches per second. That speed is very quick; however, if 
you exceed that limit, the pointer may not perfectly track the movement of the mouse.

The Mac allows you to modify certain aspects of the mouse&rsquo;s operation. The 
Control Panel option in the Apple menu has two mouse-related control features. 
You can choose from among three settings to determine the length of time between 
clicks that will effect a double-click.
</p><p>
The other mouse control feature, <i>scaling,</i> involves the relationship between the 
speed of mouse movement and the distance covered by the pointer on the screen. 
You can set the mouse scaling so that the pointer addresses each dot on the screen, 
or you can speed up mouse movement by setting the mouse scaling so that the pointer skips 
over every other dot on the screen. However, the scaling feature will not work unless 
you move the mouse rather quickly; moving the mouse slowly will address each dot 
no matter which option is selected.
</p><p>
Apple&rsquo;s research showed that the one-button configuration makes it easier and 
less confusing for people learning to use the mouse. For more expert usage, the 
mouse can be used in conjunction with the keyboard. In <i>MacPaint,</i> for example, 
holding down the Option key while you drag a selected part of a drawing will 
&ldquo;stretch&rdquo; the image.

The mouse is a sturdy beast, but don&rsquo;t let it fall off the table or allow your dog 
or cat to chew on it. Having your workspace as free of dust as possible helps to 
keep the mouse in good working condition. You should also clean the mouse periodically. 
The Macintosh owner&rsquo;s manual gives detailed instructions for this simple procedure.
</p><p class=caption>
It&rsquo;s in the software
</p><p>
The mouse will come of age in the 1980s because the software developers at Apple have created 
a working environment that superbly implements mouse technology. The mouse did not 
become a part of the Mac system as an afterthought, but, as in the design for the 
Lisa, was part of the overall concept from the beginning. The Mac&rsquo;s mouse-driven, 
uniform working environment allows users to concentrate on their tasks, rather than on 
memorizing the keyboard commands and eccentricities of various application programs.
</p><p>
As the community of Mac users multiplies, and as other computer manufacturers adopt 
similar mouse-based working environments, the mouse will become a constant companion 
of the keyboard, taking over many of its functions. The mouse may not be the ultimate 
device for interfacing with computers, but for the time being it&rsquo;s the 
best system yet devised for making computers more compatible with the people who use them.
