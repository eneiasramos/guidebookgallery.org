The Finder: in a world of operating systems with names like 
MS-DOS, XENIX, and CP/M-86, the name of the Macintosh&rsquo;s new 
operating system sounds both friendly and nontechnical. That&rsquo;s 
what Apple had in mind.
</p><p>
Early in the Macintosh design process, Apple set an objective &ndash; 
to make its new computer immediately useful to a novice. Apple&rsquo;s 
computer needed an operating system that was easy to learn. To this 
end, Apple designed a window and mouse operating system, called the 
Finder, using the graphic symbol concepts the corporation had 
developed for its more expensive Lisa computer. The Finder is 
friendly to the novice. People with little or no computer experience 
can sit down before a Macintosh and perform useful work in a short 
time. But users are novices only once, and more experienced computer 
users who are new to the Macintosh may find conventional 
command-oriented operating systems more intelligible.
</p><p class=caption>
Internal Organization
</p><p>
The Finder is only the top level of a multilevel Macintosh operating 
system. The lowest level consists of various hardware interfaces and 
drivers and occupies about a third of the 64K-byte ROM in the 
Macintosh. The next level is the user-interface toolbox, which 
contains a wide variety of routines for implementing complex 
window/mouse-based programs. This code occupies the remaining two-thirds 
of ROM. At the highest level of these ROM routines is the Finder 
program itself, stored as a disk file. The Finder has an accompanying 
file, called the System file, mainly used to store font images, icon 
images, and text messages but also some code. The Finder program 
manages the Macintosh&rsquo;s desktop. It is equivalent to the 
command-line interpreter part of a more conventional operating system.
</p><p>
The Finder is a rather large program. If it were to stay in memory 
all the time, little memory would be left for application programs. 
Therefore, the Finder is dumped from memory whenever you start 
an application program. This differs from most microcomputer operating 
systems, which stay in memory and provide an interface between the 
application program and the hardware. Macintosh application programs 
do not work through the Finder; they access the Macintosh hardware 
by calling the routines in ROM on their own.
</p><p>
When you return to the Finder, the computer essentially performs a 
&ldquo;warm boot&rdquo; and reloads the Finder from disk. 
This makes quitting an application program a relatively time-consuming 
task (often taking 15 or 20 seconds).
</p><p class=caption>
Finder Concepts
</p><p>
The Finder is built around several key concepts: the desktop 
metaphor, data as objects, mouse integration, and the shared 
user interface.
</p><p>
<b>Desktop Metaphor:</b> The computer&rsquo;s screen can be 
represented as a desktop. A number of items can be present on 
the screen &ldquo;desk&rdquo; at one time, just as you can have 
a calendar, file folder, and notepad on an actual desktop.
</p><p>
<b>Data as Objects:</b> Data, whether in programs or files, 
can be represented as objects on the desktop. You can move
them around. The Finder assigns graphic symbols (called icons) to 
such data-objects.
</p><p>
<b>Mouse Integration:</b> The mouse is an integral part of the 
Finder; it controls the cursor and is your interface to the 
operating system. The Macintosh does not include any cursor-control 
keys, and you cannot use the Finder without using the mouse.
</p><p>
<b>Shared User Interface:</b> The Macintosh provides a consistent 
user interface for all programs. This ROM (read-only memory) 
interface allows different programs to share and exchange data. 
To run efficiently, all software must adhere to this common 
interface.

Suppose you want to use your Macintosh to write a letter. The 
basic steps are start the computer, load and run a word-processing 
program, and copy the newly created letter to a separate disk 
for backup. (I&rsquo;ll ignore printing the letter for the purposes of 
this example.)
</p><p>
When you first turn on the Macintosh, the screen prompts you 
to insert a disk by displaying a disk icon with a question mark. 
(You may turn the computer on with the disk already in the computer 
if you wish.) After you insert a disk, the desktop is set up, 
and an icon representing the disk you inserted is displayed in the 
upper right-hand corner of the desktop (<a href='articles/evaluatingthemacintoshfinder/pics/fig1'>figure 1</a>). The name of 
the disk (&ldquo;Write&rdquo; in this example) is displayed underneath 
the icon. Write contains the word-processing program you will be using.
</p><p>
To access the contents of Write, you select the disk by moving 
the pointer over the disk icon and pressing the mouse button. 
(The pointer is a little arrow on the desktop that you move 
around with the mouse.) This causes the icon to darken, indicating 
that Write has been selected. Next, you move the pointer up 
to the menu bar (the top line of the screen where various menu 
categories are displayed) and position it over File. When you 
press and hold down the mouse button &ndash; an operation called 
&ldquo;dragging&rdquo; &ndash; the menu choices under File pop down from
the menu bar like a window roller shade (<a href='articles/evaluatingthemacintoshfinder/pics/fig2'>figure 2</a>). Since you 
want to &ldquo;open up&rdquo; the Write disk, you move the pointer 
down to the OPEN command and release the mouse button. This opens 
a window on the desktop that displays the contents of 
Write (<a href='articles/evaluatingthemacintoshfinder/pics/fig3'>figure 3</a>).
</p><p>
One of the files displayed in the window is the word-processing 
program you want to use &ndash; MacWrite. Starting the word processor 
involves the same sequence of steps used to open the disk: 
you select the MacWrite icon by clicking on it, then you drag 
the File menu down to the OPEN command. This opens a new window 
for the word-processing program (<a href='articles/evaluatingthemacintoshfinder/pics/fig4'>figure 4</a>).
</p><p>
After exiting the word processor, the Finder dumps you back to 
the desktop. As you can see in <a href='articles/evaluatingthemacintoshfinder/pics/fig5'>figure 5</a>, a new icon is now 
visible (labeled &ldquo;Smith 5/19&rdquo;); it represents the document 
file for the letter you wrote with MacWrite.
</p><p>
To back this file up, you need to copy it to another disk. First 
you need to put the backup disk on the desktop. If you have two 
disk drives, you simply insert the backup disk in the second 
drive. If you have a single-drive Macintosh, you need to eject the 
Write disk by selecting the Write disk icon and selecting Eject with 
the File menu. You then can insert the backup disk. In either 
case, a new disk icon (previously labeled &ldquo;Backup&rdquo;) 
representing the backup disk appears on the screen.
</p><p>
Copying a file involves dragging its file icon to the desired 
destination. In this case, you need to drag the Smith 5/19 file 
icon to the Backup disk icon (<a href='articles/evaluatingthemacintoshfinder/pics/fig6'>figure 6</a>). The Finder will 
then copy the file. If you have a single-drive Macintosh, you 
are in for a few disk swaps. (The Macintosh always ejects a 
disk and prompts you for the name of the next disk it
wants during disk swaps.)
</p><p class=caption>
Finder Performance
</p><p>
But how well does the Finder perform? I evaluated the Finder 
in seven general areas: speed, ease of use, hardware insulation, 
flexibility, overhead, interfacing capabilities, and ease of 
program development. 
</p><p>
Although this is not intended to be a rigid evaluation, with 
benchmarks and the like, I used MS-DOS 2.0 (running on a 
floppy-disk-based IBM PC) as a general yardstick for comparison. 
</p><p>
<b>Speed:</b> The Finder seems very quick and responsive, as long 
as disk I/O (input/output) is not involved. Window operations 
(resizing, opening/closing, and scrolling) are virtually instantaneous.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the small Macintosh memory necessitates frequent 
trips to the disk drive. In these cases, the Finder seems quite 
slow compared to MS-DOS. Opening or quitting an application 
program typically takes from 15 to 30 seconds (30 to 60 seconds 
for the round trip). MS-DOS can typically load or quit application 
programs in a few seconds. Inserting or ejecting a disk takes from 
2 to 15 seconds of computer time depending on the configuration of 
windows for the disk and how many disk icons are on the 
&ldquo;desktop.&rdquo; With MS-DOS, disk handling is not under 
software control, so no computer time is required. Finally, 
the Finder takes from two to fives times longer than MS-DOS to 
copy files from disk to disk. This disadvantage is most pronounced 
when comparing copy times on single-drive computers.
</p><p>
At times, these delays make the Finder cumbersome. For example, 
suppose you wanted to copy one small file to several different disks. 
With the Finder, you need to go through an ejection/insertion 
step for each disk just to get each disk icon on the screen: 
this can easily take 20 or more seconds of computer time per 
disk. With MS-DOS, you can perform this task as quickly as 
you can get disks in and out of the drive.
</p><p>
If your work keeps you in application programs the majority of the 
time, these delays make little or no difference. However, if 
you are running several different programs (especially with a 
single-drive Macintosh), these delays can become very annoying.
</p><p>
<b>Ease of use:</b> For novice users, the Finder is much easier 
to learn than MS-DOS. Most first-time Macintosh users are able 
to understand the basics of the Finder within an hour with 
little or no reference to the manual. The novice MS-DOS user 
had better plan on some serious study of a needlessly complex 
manual followed by a few tough initial hours at the computer.
</p><p>
While the first hour with the Finder may be bliss, later hours 
may not be as smooth. First, the Finder has a great deal of 
hidden behavior, and the non-technical manual glosses over 
explanations with an &ldquo;I&rsquo;d-only-confuse-you&rdquo; 
sort of style. Second, efficient use of the Finder often requires 
careful technique in order to avoid memory and disk-space 
limitations (see <a href='articles/evaluatingthemacintoshfinder/tipsforsingledriveusers'>the sidebar, &ldquo;Tips for Single-Drive 
Users&rdquo;</a>). These techniques require a fundamental understanding 
of the Finder, which goes against its basic principles. Finally, 
the Finder gives up nothing to MS-DOS when it comes to cryptic 
keystroke/mouse sequences for a few commands (see table 1).

Apple touts the Finder as not requiring the memorization of any commands.
As this list shows, the claim is not entirely true.</td></tr>
</table>

<b>Hardware insulation:</b> The Finder does an excellent job of 
insulating users from the Macintosh hardware. Finder users can 
completely ignore issues like disk formats, serial-port 
configuration, file buffers, and device drivers because the 
Finder ignores this Macintosh hardware. While MS-DOS lets you 
access the serial port directly from the operating system, the 
Finder provides no such support; you have to use a separate 
application program.
</p><p>
<b>Flexibility:</b> One way to make an operating system easy to 
use is to limit the number of things it can do. This is the 
Finder&rsquo;s approach, and it does limit its flexibility. Here 
is a partial list of advanced operations supported by MS-DOS 
that are absent from the Finder: tree directories, batch 
processing, automatic batch-file execution, user-directed disk 
repair, user-installable device drivers, RAMdisks, I/O redirection, 
sorting, and filters. Of course, the first release of MS-DOS did 
not have many of these things, and future releases of the 
Finder may incorporate features that will make it more flexible. 
But these add-ons are likely to compromise the Finder&rsquo;s basic simplicity.
</p><p>
The Finder does support a feature that allows files to be placed 
in &ldquo;Folders,&rdquo; enabling you to organize your 
desktop in a hierarchy similar to MS-DOS&rsquo;s tree directories. 
Unfortunately, this structure extends only to the organization 
of icons on the desktop and does not allow you to set up separate 
directories, each insulated and separate from one another. This 
is no great problem for a Macintosh with its 3&frac12;-inch disks, 
because the number of files on any disk is usually small. A 
hard-disk Macintosh, on the other hand, may have thousands of 
files, and the lack of separate directories could be a problem.
</p><p>
<b>Overhead:</b> For the Finder, it can be described in a word: 
high. Apple has done quite a job of squeezing an incredibly complex 
operating system into a small amount of code, but the disk space 
and memory requirements tend to push the Macintosh&rsquo;s limited resources.

</table>

Table 2 presents a comparison of the disk-space overhead (the amount 
of disk space required to store the operating system) between the 
Finder and MS-DOS. Memory overhead (the amount of memory used by 
the operating system that is unavailable to application programs) 
is roughly similar. The Finder&rsquo;s memory overhead is about 
22K bytes, compared to about 25K bytes for MS-DOS. (This 22K is 
only the part of the operating system that stays in memory while 
the application is running; the Finder program itself is much 
larger.) Of course, 22K bytes tends to cut deeper on the Macintosh 
than it does on a typical IBM PC with a lot of RAM; the Macintosh 
is limited to 128K bytes of RAM (random-access read/write 
memory), and the display takes 21K bytes of this.
</p><p>
<b>Interfacing capabilities:</b> The Finder includes a simple but 
powerful system of exchanging text and graphic images between 
different application programs. MS-DOS has no comparable system. 
The Finder&rsquo;s system consists of two separate but complementary 
storage areas called the Clipboard and the Scrapbook. The Clipboard 
stores a single text passage or graphic image and is used as a 
temporary storage area for cutting, copying, and pasting 
operations. The Scrapbook, which can store many text passages or 
images, allows you to set up a library of frequently used items. 
Both are designed to be easily accessible from application 
programs, provided the programs are designed with the Clipboard and 
Scrapbook in mind.
</p><p>
The system works well. Its only drawback is slowness; both the 
Clipboard and Scrapbook are stored as disk files and access can be tedious.
</p><p>
<b>Ease of program development:</b> For noncommercial software 
developers, the Macintosh has (or will shortly have) a variety 
of innovative and easy-to-use interpreters in BASIC, Pascal, and 
Logo. If your program does not require the speed of a compiled program 
or large amounts of memory, the Macintosh, with its superior 
program-development and debugging capabilities, is a great machine. 
But MS-DOS is a better choice for large, complex programs that must 
run quickly. Don&rsquo;t expect to see something as powerful as 
Lotus 1-2-3 running on a 128K-byte, single-drive Macintosh.

Minimum recommended Macintosh software development system. This system allows
the development of stand-alone Macintosh software that can take control of the
entire desktop. The cost of this system (June 1984) is approximately 50 to 100
percent higher than comparable MS-DOS development systems. (Apple has a
Certified Developer Program that provides for substantial discounts for qualified
commercial software developers. However, delays of several months in
obtaining equipment have been typical.)

Commercial software developers, who typically want to develop 
high-performance, stand-alone, compiled programs, share a 
problem. Macintosh software development requires a significant
investment in terms of time and money. Programming is complex. 
Apple has not done a good job of distributing quality technical 
documents. Currently, you need a Lisa system to develop stand-alone
application programs (table 3).

Conclusions
</p><p>
The Finder provides an excellent environment for the novice computer 
user, and nearly everyone will find it fun to work with. It does 
especially well in providing a graphic representation of your 
data and programs. And the Finder&rsquo;s method of exchanging 
data between application programs is innovative and powerful.
</p><p>
The Finder&rsquo;s weaknesses are not as obvious, but just as 
real. For one, the system seems... well, ponderous might be the 
best word. Simple tasks often seem to occur in slow motion as the
Finder shuttles back and forth to disk for code and data. The 
lack of any batch-processing capability means repetitious command sequences 
must be clicked or keyed in each time they are needed. But 
these drawbacks are largely academic if you stay in application 
programs most of the time. The window/mouse concept works 
beautifully in programs like MacPaint, MacDraw, and Microsoft 
Chart; it just doesn&rsquo;t seem to come off as well with the Finder.
</p><p>
Specialized application-program support is also a weak area for 
the Finder. The Macintosh is not an easy system to develop programs 
for, and Apple has compounded the problem by failing to provide 
quality technical information and software tools for the small 
software developer. The common applications will be well served by 
giants like Microsoft, but don&rsquo;t expect commercial programs for 
managing your bowling league any time soon. The Finder is definitely 
not the operating system for the hacker.
</p><p>
More than anything, the Finder, like the Macintosh, is an enigma. 
It is an extremely elegant operating system that is seriously 
flawed because Apple did not provide sufficient memory and disk 
storage in the basic Macintosh. (Apple&rsquo;s decision to limit 
the Macintosh to 128K bytes &ndash; and to solder the chips 
directly to the main digital board &ndash; is unfathomable.) Too 
often, the Finder simply overwhelms the hardware. With 512K 
bytes and double-sided disk drives, the Finder will probably perform 
effectively. Until then, it will continue to attract new 
people to computers and frustrate users who need to get a 
lot of work done quickly.
