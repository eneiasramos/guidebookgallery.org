The industry knew that the litigious Apple Computer Corp. would take action. The 
question was when. That question was answered on Thursday, March 17, when Apple 
filed a lawsuit claiming that Microsoft had violated terms of an agreement to 
use certain Apple technologies in the user interface of 
<a href='guis/windows/win10'><i>Windows</i> 1.0</a>.

According to Apple, Microsoft has gone too far with its release 
of <a href='guis/windows/win20'><i>Windows</i> 2.03</a>. Hewlett-Packard was 
also named in the suit after it produced a new <i>Executive</i> for <i>Windows</i> 
called <i>New Wave,</i> which turned out to be a clone of the Macintosh 
interface. (In the There&rsquo;s No Such Thing as Bad Publicity Dept.: Orders for 
<i>New Wave</i> developers&rsquo; kits have skyrocketed since Apple&rsquo;s suit 
was announced. Whatever happens to HP legally, the company can&rsquo;t be <i>too</i>
distressed about the suit just now.)
</p><p>
Apple&rsquo;s action will result in lots of theorizing. Here are some facts and 
some observations. Let&rsquo;s start in 1985, when Apple first thought of suing 
Microsoft for using techniques patented by Apple (under patent
number 4,464,652) and for using certain Apple visual copyrights. Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates got wind of this potential suit and flew down with a lawyer to 
Cupertino. In a late night meeting with Apple CEO John Sculley, he threatened to 
stop development of all Mac software if Apple pursued legal action. This incident 
is outlined in Sculley&rsquo;s book, <i>Odyssey,</i> where the story ends with the 
simple statement: &ldquo;We made our peace in November.&rdquo;
</p><p>
What wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in the book, and the reason the attorney accompanied Gates, was
that Sculley was asked to sign a document that gave Microsoft royalty-free rights 
to the Apple patents and to the copyrights to the visual screens. To add insult 
to injury, there was an indemnification clause making Microsoft immune from any 
third-party suits over the interface. All Apple got from Gates was an assurance 
that Mac development would continue. As a gratuity, Microsoft granted Apple the 
rights to the visual copyrights to any <i>Windows</i> screens it developed from 1985 
to 1990.
</p><p>
Sculley, not sure if Gates was serious about stopping Mac development during 
a crucial period for the Mac, signed the document on November 22, 1985.

Most insiders believe Gates was bluffing, since much of his company was concentrating 
on Mac development. Whatever the case, the document also made it clear 
that Microsoft did not have to credit Apple or make it known that Microsoft had 
permission to use certain Apple technologies. To the outside world there was 
no agreement. Both companies agreed to make the secret document public on March 
21, 1988, as part of the litigation and disclosure process.
</p><p>
The agreement also said that if the agreement was breached in any way it would be 
invalidated. Publicizing and invalidating the original agreement may be Apple&rsquo;s 
ultimate goal. All Apple needed was one slip by Microsoft. In fact, it may be 
that Microsoft&rsquo;s use of the number 2.03 in the release for which it is 
being sued is the slip-up. The secret document specified that only Version 1.0 was 
covered. Microsoft claims that the only additional features in 2.03 are 
proprietary. The courts will decide these issues.
</p><p>
If there is a small violation ol the agreement, then Microsoft and, presumably, 
IBM and others have a problem. Some think the shoe is on Sculley&rsquo;s foot, with 
IBM the real target of a swift kick. Gates is now caught in a bind that could 
cost Microsoft dearly if IBM is embarrassed and falls off the critical path 
leading to full implementation of SAA (Systems Applications Architecture), starting 
with the complete OS/2 Presentation Manager.
</p><p>
Obviously aimed at IBM and developers of applications running under <i>Windows</i>
and <a href='guis/os2'>OS/2</a> along with those who might be considering the 
release of a Mac clone, the suit will forestall an competition until its resolution.
</p><p>
Mention is made about how the graphical user interface was developed by Xerox and 
Apple can&rsquo;t sue anybody.
</p><p>
The fact is, Apple own rights to the interface, thanks to a deal made long ago for 
which Xerox got 2 percent of Apple stock (since sold). Sun Microsystems has always 
been concerned about the proprietary aspect of the interface and quietly 
obtained a license from Xerox long ago. And even Microsoft has a license from 
Xerox.
</p><p>
Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t like to license anything and rarely talks about its 
agreement with Xerox. Microsoft likes to think of itself as a licenser, not 
a licensee. It was probably to protect that image that Gates insisted that 
the Apple agreement be held in confidence. It can also be argued, though, 
that the agreement was an embarrassment to both companies since it is 
so one-sided. Surely, it would not pass the scrutiny of a public forum.
