Okay, the wait&rsquo;s over and Windows 95 is finally here. You&rsquo;ve got it 
installed and found that it&rsquo;s everything Microsoft promised. Right? Well, 
not exactly. Windows 95 does deliver on the basic promises: It&rsquo;s a 32-bit, 
protected, multitasking operating system
with a better user interface than Windows 3.1.
</p><p>
The operating system&rsquo;s features, however, have changed a bit as Windows 95 
has evolved from its &ldquo;Chicago&rdquo; days. Microsoft has removed some 
features, added new features, or placed them in the Microsoft Plus! add-on kit.
</p><p>
Let&rsquo;s look at some of the places where Microsoft Windows 95 may be a 
little different from what you might have expected.
</p><p class=caption>
Much ado about DOS
</p><p>
The best place to start is with the most basic features of the operating system. 
Many people were surprised to find out how much DOS there still is in Windows 
95. You go through a DOS mode on booting, you can boot in DOS without 
Windows, and the operating system supports many DOS interrupts, structures, and 
device drivers. Microsoft says that the DOS support is for compatibility.
</p><p>
So what&rsquo;s the fuss about Windows 95 having DOS compatibility, and the fact 
that it still runs &ldquo;real-mode&rdquo; device drivers and programs that 
could take up its resources or even crash the whole system? Why do statements that 
provide descriptions of Windows 95&rsquo;s DOS compatibility, such as those in 
Andrew Schulman&rsquo;s book <i>Unauthorized Windows 95</i> (Read Only, April 
11, 1995), attract so much attention?
</p><p>
The answer is really very simple. Microsoft employees were not very clear when 
they started talking about &ldquo;Chicago&rdquo; a couple of years ago. They made 
statements such as &ldquo;Chicago is a 32-bit operating system that does not 
require or use a separate version of MS-DOS&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chicago is built from the 
ground up to be a 32-bit preemptive multitasking operating system. Therefore, the 
system is not bound by the constraints of MS-DOS.&rdquo; All of these things are true 
in broad outlines, but there is a bit of exaggeration. There are some parts 
of Windows 95 that use existing 16-bit code, and the OS does have some DOS constraints.
</p><p class=caption>
Changing Exchange
</p><p>
Among the essential features of Windows 95, the one that changed the most was 
Exchange. Originally called Info Center, Exchange was designed from the start to 
be a universal in-box for multiple mail servers. As shipped, Exchange will let 
you send and receive mail for Microsoft Mail, CompuServe Mail (through a driver 
that comes on the Windows 95 CD or can be downloaded), and mail from the Microsoft 
Network (MSN). But several features have been stripped down, including sorting 
and grouping by services, and advanced features such as shared folders. This, 
of course, leaves more room for third-party vendors &ndash; and Microsoft itself &ndash; 
to sell more advanced mail clients.
</p><p>
A lot of communications functions were added since Microsoft first began discussing 
the operating system, the most obvious one being the Microsoft Network, which 
attracted so much controversy over being bundled with the OS in the first place.
</p><p>
Several minor accessories have also changed. WinPad, a basic personal information 
manager, appeared in early test versions of Chicago but disappeared a while back. 
Schedule+, the group scheduling package that&rsquo;s included with Windows for 
Workgroups, is not going to be included with Windows 95. Schedule+ will now be 
a part of Microsoft Office.
</p><p>
Unlike the last few revisions of MS-DOS, Windows 95 doesn&rsquo;t come with 
a built-in antivirus utility, and older antivirus programs will probably not 
work. Several other utilities, such as Backup, do come with the base operating 
system, but you may need to install them from the Add/Remove New Programs icon 
in the control panel. At the last minute, Paint was revised so it could 
read .PCX files, but it still can&rsquo;t save them.
</p><p class=caption>
Plus! adds a lot
</p><p>
Some of these features have ended up in Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, a $49.95 
add-on package designed for those users with faster systems (486 processors or 
better). These include an enhanced version of the DriveSpace compression 
utility. The one included with the base operating system supports only drives 
compressed to allow up to 512MB, while DriveSpace 3 offers much better compression 
and works on compressed drives up to 2GB in size. Microsoft Plus! also comes 
with a Compression Agent that provides even better compression on rarely used 
individual files.
</p><p>
As for Internet functions, the basic operating system comes with simple TCP/IP 
protocol support. Microsoft Plus! now has many of the Internet tools, including 
basic dial-up features through MSN or another provider, the Internet mail connection 
for Exchange, and FTP and Gopher capability, as well as the Internet Explorer, 
Microsoft&rsquo;s own browser.
</p><p>
Other features in Microsoft Plus! include a dial-up server (so you can dial into 
your computer, as you can with Windows NT) and a System Agent that lets 
you run system maintenance tasks while your machine is idle, such as scanning the 
disk for errors, defragmenting, or backing up on a particular schedule.
</p><p>
Because Plus! was designed for 486 and faster computers, it includes some strictly 
visual things that make the system look better. In addition, it includes a 
number of new &ldquo;themes&rdquo; &ndash; combinations of color schemes, sounds, 
wallpaper, and animated icons. Try the theme &ldquo;Inside your Computer&rdquo;; 
it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.
</p><p>
Plus! will be of interest to most Windows 95 buyers. The features it offers could have
been part of Windows 95. It&rsquo;s too bad they aren&rsquo;t.
</p><p class=caption>
Tune-up needed
</p><p>
A few other things that are part of Windows 95 could be improved. Plug and Play 
still isn&rsquo;t a complete reality. To begin with, all the older systems 
and plug-in boards aren&rsquo;t plug-and-play, and while Microsoft is including 
drivers for most of them, it can only cover small part of the market. Secondly, 
while most new machines support Plug and Play, it&rsquo;s still not 
commonplace in plug-in boards. And finally, even with a Plug and Play machine 
and a set of Plug and Play cards, you may still have some problems. That&rsquo;s to be 
expected. The great strength &ndash; and the greal weakness &ndash; of the PC 
market is the diversity of products out there.
</p><p>
Similarly, of course, there are a number of little things that could be 
improved; that&rsquo;s to be expected with any program. The &ldquo;tune up kit&rdquo; 
promised for this fall will undoubtedly fix some problems, and leave others for 
the future.
</p><p>
The bottom line is that Windows 95 may not be everything we could have 
wanted, but it&rsquo;s still a big step forward, and we&rsquo;re glad to 
have it finally here.
