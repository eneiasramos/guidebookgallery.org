<p>
When the Apple II first appeared in 1977, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs made an analogy between the 
automobile and the personal computer. He predicted that the personal computer would be put to 
many uses as yet unimagined &ndash; just as cars have, since their introduction, been put to many uses 
that turn-of-the-century automobile makers couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen.
</p><p>
Practically every day, Jobs&rsquo;s forecast is proven accurate. Who could have imagined seven years 
ago that the Apple would be used for controlling the environment of a home, creating music, designing 
everything from ultralights to solar-heated houses, and helping the handicapped? Who could have 
imagined that the Apple would play an integral part in the running of tens of thousands of small businesses 
in this country and around the world?
</p><p>
When they first appeared, automobiles were by themselves a promising technology, but without good roads 
they couldn&rsquo;t have competed with horses or even a physically fit individual. Software is to computers 
what roads are to cars. The usefulness of the Apple II, Apple III, and now the Lisa depends on 
smooth, well-designed routes that lead to desired goals.
</p><p class=caption>
Paving the Way
</p><p>
Apple Computer has attracted some of the most innovative and expert road builders in 
the computer world. Some of these master paviors work directly for Apple, but by far the majority are 
independent, strong-spirited individuals or groups that have adopted the Apple as the informational tool 
of today and tomorrow. Apple has been lucky and so have the rest of us, the users.
</p><p>
BPI Systems of Austin, Texas, is one of these master paviors. By last count, upward of one hundred thousand 
microcomputer systems are equipped with one or more of BPI&rsquo;s accounting software packages. BPI is a 
remarkable success story that begins, like so many others, with a small, tight-knit group of entrepreneurs 
and their recognition that a personal computer needs a good road.
</p><p>
John Moss, chairman of the board at BPI, is semiretired nowadays, not taking part in the day-to-day 
activities of running the company. An accountant by trade, Moss spent thirty years of his life owning 
and operating small businesses. It was his energy and business instincts that got BPI started in the late 
seventies and steered the company onto its continuing course of success.
</p><p>
In 1977, Moss was overseeing a franchise chain of retail food stores in Texas when he realized that an accounting 
system using microcomputers could improve the operation. The general accounting for Moss&rsquo;s operation 
was sent to an outside accounting firm that used mainframes.
</p><p>
The time required to get the information to and from the accounting firm caused some of the smaller 
stores in Moss&rsquo;s chain to be behind the times. They couldn&rsquo;t react very fast to the 
changing market scene. Moss, who had seen Radio Shack&rsquo;s TRS-80 Model I, realized that microcomputers 
could offer the individual accountant a way to manipulate financial data quickly and easily. He envisioned 
a system similar to, but scaled down from, what the big accounting firms used.
</p><p>
&ldquo;John is not a programmer,&rdquo; says Randy Ferguson, BPI&rsquo;s president. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a 
visionary who saw the potential of the microcomputer to help with these aspects of running a small business.&rdquo;
</p><p class=caption>
General DeBower
</p><p>
In 1978, Moss met Ken DeBower, a data processing professional with nearly eighteen 
years&rsquo; experience. Moss hired DeBower to write a general ledger program for use in his retail food 
store chain. Working weekends, DeBower wrote the general ledger program on the Apple II; and, 
other than one major revision, the program has remained the same through the years and is used by 
tens of thousands of businesses.
</p><p>
Woe to the entrepreneur who misses an opportunity. Moss showed the general ledger program to a computer store 
dealer in Dallas and struck up a deal wherein he and DeBower would deliver five hundred systems over the 
course of five months. Moss wrote the user manual for the product and the program became very popular with 
those who ran across it in those early days.
</p><p>
At the same time that Moss and DeBower were starting their modest accounting software business, Randy 
Ferguson, a native Texan, was starting a similar scheme.
</p><p>
Ferguson, who was vice president of operations at the Austin National Bank, was trying to find 
an accounts-receivable system for his twin brother&rsquo;s small business. Ferguson had spent five years in 
the data processing department at the Austin National Bank working in sales.
He&rsquo;d also done a small amount of programming on Wang minicomputers.
</p><p>
Early in 1979, Ferguson wrote an accounts-receivable program for his brother on the Apple II and 
was so impressed with the outcome that he decided to start selling it.
</p><p>
As fate would have it, Ferguson and Moss met in a Waco computer store when Ferguson went searching 
on his brother&rsquo;s behalf for a general ledger program. Ferguson found the program and 
his future business partners.
</p><p>
In the summer of 1979, Moss, DeBower, and Ferguson each put up a thousand dollars and formed BPI Systems. 
The company&rsquo;s initials stand for business, professional, and industrial, which are the three 
main markets the trio decided to go after. The first general ledger programs started shipping in July 
1979 and BPI was off and running.
</p><p class=caption>
Good News Travels Fast
</p><p>
From the start, the company seemed destined for success. Within half a 
year of having formed BPI, DeBower and Ferguson quit their regular jobs to devote all their time and 
energy to the company. Their first two products were well received and, despite the lack of 
firm distribution networks, the good word about BPI&rsquo;s products spread &ndash; it spread all the 
way to the heights of Mount Olympus.
</p><p>
Both Commodore and Atari were impressed with BPI&rsquo;s accounting software and struck up mass purchase 
deals in 1980. In those early days, BPI hit upon a good scheme that circumvented the dearth of 
distributors &ndash; sell programs en masse to computer manufacturers and let them handle the distribution. 
By 1980, small business applications and microcomputers seemed the perfect marriage. The personal computer 
manufacturers saw a way to sell more machines, and a remarkable number came knocking on BPI&rsquo;s door.
</p><p>
By midyear BPI was shipping three to four hundred packages a month. The company was run entirely by 
Moss, DeBower, Ferguson, and Moss&rsquo;s wife Margaret. In November of that year, the company hired 
its first salaried employee.
</p><p>
The biggest milestone in the company&rsquo;s history came when Apple Computer inquired about distributing 
BPI&rsquo;s accounting software for the Apple II. A deal was struck in short order and 
BPI started shipping thousands of products a month.
</p><p>
The mutually beneficial relationship between Apple and BPI relies on the particular strengths of 
the two companies. BPI produces the products, including packaging and documentation, and provides 
support, while Apple markets and distributes them. It&rsquo;s a relationship that both corporate entities have been 
pleased with and hope will continue for some time.
</p><p>
BPI and Apple are of like mind. Recent estimates put the penetration of microcomputers into the 
potential small business market at 5 percent. And the size of the small business market is enormous. 
Ferguson calls it &ldquo;the Fortune fourteen million.&rdquo; Any serious attempt to capture a 
large part of that market cannot be a half effort. Joining forces gives both parties a fighting chance 
and is often the most efficient use of available resources.
</p><p class=caption>
The OEM Connection
</p><p>
Until this year, BPI operated for the most part like an OEM (original equipment 
manufacturer) supplier, shipping its prepacked accounting software to computer manufacturers, who marketed 
and distributed it. The level of expertise &ndash; in documentation, support, packaging, and 
programming &ndash; demanded of BPI is no less than that demanded of a more maverick operation, which 
must attract distributors and dealers by the quality of the product and not by the fact 
that an Apple Computer or an IBM has put its name on it.
</p><p>
Many factors go into the making of a successful software publishing firm like BPI. One vital factor 
is skilled, creative people. Once the business began to take off, BPI was fortunate enough to attract 
a number of talented individuals.
</p><p>
Ann Oppenlander, BPI&rsquo;s vice president of customer support and documentation, joined the company 
in January 1981. Oppenlander, who has a Ph.D. in English, brought to the firm considerable experience 
in documentation writing. Prior to joining BPI she&rsquo;d worked at NCR, programming business applications on 
DEC mainframes, and had spent two years as manager of Texas Instruments&rsquo;s publications department.
</p><p>
When she saw BPI&rsquo;s products, Oppenlander was impressed and accepted Moss&rsquo;s offer to join 
the young company. She started on the telephone, answering customer-support calls and learning 
the &ldquo;audience,&rdquo; which she says was quite different from what she was used to at TI.
</p><p>
&ldquo;At Texas Instruments, we were writing manuals for programmers. Here was a challenge to 
make them understandable to everyday people.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Both Ferguson and Oppenlander are convinced that, a clear, concise, understandable manual is a critical 
aspect of putting out a successful software product for the personal computer market. &ldquo;In this 
industry,&rdquo; says Ferguson, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a case of data processing products being 
produced by data processing people for non-data processing users.&rdquo;
</p><p>
By having the dual responsibility of producing the manuals and overseeing the customer-service area, 
Oppenlander knows how users are responding to BPI&rsquo;s products on a daily basis. The company 
regularly receives between five thousand and six thousand calls a month, and a careful 
tally is kept on the nature of the calls.
</p><p class=caption>
Master of Operations
</p><p>
BPI&rsquo;s vice president of operations, Larry Pickel, joined the company 
early in 1981. He spent nine years with the Austin National Bank in a number of diverse positions, 
including operations and data processing. For a while, he worked with Ferguson at the bank, and that 
previous association helped land him the job at BPI.
</p><p>
Pickel refers to his basic responsibilities as making sure &ldquo;the ox gets out of the ditch.&rdquo; He 
oversees the product management and administration of BPI. He has two adept managers working under him, 
one in charge of production and one in charge of administration.
</p><p>
Pickel, like so many in the microcomputer software industry, left a good, solid job for the 
uncertainty (and excitement) of software publishing and is glad he did.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Where I&rsquo;m going I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But it took something to make 
me leave an officer&rsquo;s chair at the bank to come here. All of us &ndash; Ken, Randy, Ann &ndash; are not 
here just to make a quick profit. We&rsquo;re here for the long haul.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Gerald I. Greifer is BPI&rsquo;s comptroller and assistant secretary. A CPA by profession, Greifer comes from 
the world of New York City high finance, where he was with Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell, the largest accounting 
firm in the world.
</p><p>
In the spring of 1981, Greifer helped Moss and Ferguson on BPI&rsquo;s Payroll package update 
as a private consultant. With his knowledge and experience, Greifer has been invaluable to the 
development of BPI&rsquo;s products. He joined BPI full-time in November 1981.
</p><p>
Greifer believes that BPI&rsquo;s potential for growth is &ldquo;unlimited, if we do the right things. 
This is a small company by New York standards, but it&rsquo;s not disorganized. They say that large companies 
have meetings too often and that small companies don&rsquo;t meet often enough. Large companies can get 
very political in their structure. BPI is the perfect world for me.&rdquo;
</p><p class=caption>
Accounting Triumvirate
</p><p>
The three top execs that hold the reins at BPI, now that Moss is not 
in the office on a day-to-day basis, are Ferguson, DeBower, and Thomas Meadows.
</p><p>
DeBower attended the University of Nebraska and discovered computers in the early sixties. He&rsquo;s worked as 
a programmer at Texas Instruments and Radian Corporation, an environmental and energy consulting firm. 
The only bonus he ever got at Radian he spent one afternoon on an Apple II. He saw the computer as 
his ticket to greater things.
</p><p>
As BPI&rsquo;s executive vice president, DeBower spends a lot of time helping to move the company&rsquo;s 
programs over to other microcomputers. He sees computer hardware getting smaller and faster in the 
future. &ldquo;Computers are still almost a toy, kind of backward,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;The microcomputer 
industry is heading toward machines with minicomputerlike performance and capabilities for multiple users.&rdquo;
</p><p>
BPI&rsquo;s senior vice president and secretary, Thomas Meadows, came from IBM, where 
he held various marketing and management positions. For a while after that, he had his own consulting 
firm. A little over a year ago, he came to BPI.
</p><p>
Meadows is a confident and likable marketer who spends a lot of his time on the road, spreading the word 
about BPI&rsquo;s products. His job is of paramount importance because the basic strategy at BPI is changing.
</p><p>
Last year, the company was totally an OEM supplier, but this year it&rsquo;s trying something new. Ferguson 
says the firm is moving into selected vertical markets on its own and that these kinds of efforts 
will account for 40 percent of the company&rsquo;s products in 1983.
</p><p>
Programs like <i>Church Management, Speed Reading, Professional Time Accounting,</i> and now BPI&rsquo;s 
accounting software for the Lisa are
just some of the products that the company will market and advertise on its own.
</p><p class=caption>
The Third GAP
</p><p>
BPI&rsquo;s and Apple&rsquo;s relationship has continued with the Apple IIe and the 
Apple III. BPI&rsquo;s <i>General Accounting Package</i> for the Apple III is currently going into full 
distribution. The experience BPI has accumulated while creating accounting software for the Apple II 
family of computers over the years is reflected in the Apple III package.
</p><p>

Last year, in September, Apple approached BPI about producing accounting software for the Lisa. Apple 
shipped a Lisa to BPI in the first week of October and sent a couple more in the early part of 
this year. Under the guidance of Pascal systems group manager David Powers and programmer Andy Chisholm, the 
project has gone smoothly and matured quickly. BPI&rsquo;s accounting software is the first from an 
independent publisher to take advantage of the Lisa&rsquo;s advanced features.
</p><p>
The Lisa project came at a good time because BPI was well into creating the Pascal code for the 
<i>General Accounting Package</i> for the Apple III. Doing so was simply a matter of moving the 
application code from the III to the Lisa and then building a software shell that capitalizes on 
Lisa&rsquo;s functions.
</p><p>
BPI has three accounting programs that run on the Lisa: <i>General Accounting Reports, Accounts 
Receivable Reports,</i> and <i>Accounts Payable Reports.</i> After booting the system, you put in 
one of BPI&rsquo;s application disks (or &ldquo;twiggies,&rdquo; as Powers likes to call the Lisa&rsquo;s 
new style of high-density, dual-window disks). The software takes you right to what is 
called the environment window, a menu that allows you to use Lisa&rsquo;s Desktop Manager, the ProFile 
hard disk, or the BPI system.
</p><p>
The program shell is similar to Lisa&rsquo;s office environment. It uses hierarchical menus and icons 
for particular functions, all controllable by the Lisa&rsquo;s mouse/pointer. Except when you&rsquo;re entering 
the basic financial data, which is done by using Lisa&rsquo;s ten-key numeric keypad, the mouse is 
all you need to work with the system.
</p><p>
Each of BPI&rsquo;s programs for the Lisa includes the Disk Document Manager, which permits you to 
delete or preserve documents on disks and perform a variety of other related data management tasks. 
Within the Disk Document Manager is the query feature, which allows you to look at a particular 
listing or find a stored document without terminating the primary function in process.
</p><p>
BPI&rsquo;s Lisa packages should be appearing in a matter of months, released by BPI but not distributed 
by Apple. A payroll package for the Lisa is also in the works.
</p><p class=caption>
Streets of Financial Fire
</p><p>
In June 1982, BPI made a public stock offering, and a little over 
a month ago the company had its first annual stockholders meeting. For the fiscal year ending 
March 31, 1983, BPI reported total revenues of a little more than $6 million and net earnings 
of $1.5 million. Three years earlier, those figures were seventy thousand dollars and twenty-five hundred dollars 
respectively.
</p><p>
The company has grown in three years from a half dozen or so employees to around one hundred twenty. BPI 
occupies several buildings within a mile of each other off Guadalupe, one of Austin&rsquo;s main 
drags, just up the street from the University of Texas. BPI has purchased land and is constructing its own 
building, which the company hopes to occupy by the end of 1984.
</p><p>
Austin, as it turns out, is a good location for a high-tech company. The University of Texas regularly turns 
out a large crop of bright and eager graduates in computer science and engineering. There are also several 
large computer firms in the area, such as Texas Instruments and Intel. Most recently, the Microelectronics 
and Computer Technology Corporation, a research corporation founded by a consortium of American computer 
firms, moved into the area.
</p><p>
BPI serves nine main clients as an OEM supplier. The nine are Apple, Atari, Commodore, DEC, 
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, NEC, Sanyo, and Texas Instruments.
</p><p>
&ldquo;We view ourselves as an extension of the hardware manufacturers&rsquo; organizations,&rdquo; says 
Meadows. &ldquo;Each of the nine is different. Yet we have the ability to adapt and do things their way.&rdquo;
</p><p>
With new directions, a solid working relationship with most of the big-name microcomputer manufacturers, and 
a competent, professional staff, BPI is a vital element in the world of financial software. Ferguson believes 
the company has brought together three professions &ndash; journalism, accounting, and programming &ndash; into 
a triple-threat force.
