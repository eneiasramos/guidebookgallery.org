The best microcomputer user interface needs revamping, lest it turn from
state-of-the-art to stodgy
</p><p>
A month ago, my NeXT computer showed up, with its 17-inch MegaPixel display, 
256-megabyte optical disk drive, 660-megabyte hard disk drive, and 400-dot-per-inch 
laser printer. During my first two weeks with the NeXT computer, my thoughts 
haven&rsquo;t focused so much on this machine as on the Macintosh. I find 
myself thinking about how far the Mac has progressed in the last five years 
and how it compares to the NeXT computer.
</p><p>
Upon considerable reflection, I have to once again give my kudos to Apple 
for producing what I still think is the best personal computer on the 
market. Not the fastest. Not the sexiest. Not the most powerful. Not the 
most expandable. Certainly not the cheapest. Just the best. So why is the Mac 
the best microcomputer around? Its user interface.
</p><p>
More people can fire up a Macintosh right out of the box and start getting 
work done the same day. Regardless of arguments to the contrary from 
devotees of other user interfaces, and regardless of the inroads made on 
the interface elements that we all think of as distinctly Macintosh (e.g., graphics, 
icons, mouse, pull-down menus, special sound cues, and many user-definable 
options), the Mac&rsquo;s interface remains preeminent among those available today.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, during my first month of fiddling with the NeXT computer and 
its beta 0.8 software and Mach operating system, it has become clear to me that 
the once state-of-the-art Macintosh interface is really starting to show its 
age. Regardless of how Apple modifies the Macintosh operating system over the 
next couple of years to make it more powerful and better able to extract the 
full horsepower out of its hardware, the company must also extend and improve 
its aging user interface.
</p><p>
I&rsquo;ve put together a list of possible improvements for future Mac 
interfaces. It&rsquo;s quite likely that some of these ideas couldn&rsquo;t be 
easily applied without an extensive overhaul of the System, Finder, and 
MultiFinder. So be it.
</p><p>
Apple&rsquo;s real competitive advantage in today&rsquo;s microcomputer 
market is the Macintosh user interface. In fact, that&rsquo;s always been 
the case. That&rsquo;s why I (unlike other industry watchers) don&rsquo;t 
really have a problem with Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; lawsuit 
against Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft. Apple should protect its 
intellectual property.
</p><p>
Regardless of whether the company has a legal leg to stand on in its suit, 
Apple&rsquo;s moral obligations are quite clear: It owes it to its shareholders 
and customers (many of whom put their professional lives in jeopardy to 
bring Macs into their companies a few years ago) to protect the interface 
from being ripped off by competitors. Apple spent considerable time 
and money on developing the Mac interface; in my opinion, the company is 
entitled to reap whatever rewards the marketplace deems appropriate for 
its actions.
</p><p>
My suggestions for improving the Mac interface assume that some important 
new computing paradigms aren&rsquo;t put on the market by Apple or others over 
the next two years. If you assume that the
microcomputer interface market will continue to make incremental improvements 
over that period, then my suggestions fit right in.
</p><p>
Improvements need to be made in six different areas: the desktop, file 
management, the use of sound, the way windows are displayed and used, general 
operation, and the integration of development and user environments.
</p><p>
The Apple Desktop has aged less gracefully than any other part of the 
Macintosh interface. A month&rsquo;s worth of NeXT work, plus daily work with 
other interfaces, like X Windows, has made this clear to me.
</p><p>
Apple needs to make the Desktop more dynamic, more configurable, and more 
powerful. For example, why can&rsquo;t you tear off any item on the Mac 
menu and stick it on the screen (open, of course) where you need it? Sure, 
you can do this with some individual software, and some shareware utilities add 
this capability to programs, but it needs to be a standard feature, built 
in and available to developers.
</p><p>
In the same vein, how about resizable menus? Or how about menu items that 
you can link to function or option keys for one-time use and that revert back 
to some status quo? How about the ability to place menus at the bottom of the 
screen, or on the left or right side, or to get rid of them altogether?
</p><p>
The basic point here is that the current pull-down Mac menus are too staid and 
too static. You should be able to reconfigure them and store Desktop configuration 
settings. That way, you can create and save a number of customized working 
environments attached to specific applications.
</p><p>
Naturally, a configurable Desktop needs some real computing power behind it. 
To accommodate the interface changes I&rsquo;ve suggested, the Macintosh operating 
system will have to become fully multitasking and will have to offer all the 
features that a fully multitasking system demands. Such features would have 
to include virtual memory paging, preemptive event scheduling, and interprocess 
and interapplication communications.
</p><p>
Once Apple has strengthened the Desktop, the company should improve file 
management capabilities. The biggest change, which could also be categorized 
as a Desktop or general operational improvement, would be the introduction 
of a command-line interface.
</p><p>
I&rsquo;m not arguing here for a return to MS-DOS&rsquo;s C&gt; prompt or 
Unix&rsquo;s % prompt, but the Mac needs some kind of shell window (similar 
to Unix running with X Windows or Mach running with NextStep) that can 
be popped up as needed for direct file management operations. This shell window 
could also be used instead of pull-down menus if a power user felt 
so inclined. But the real purpose of the shell window would be to manipulate 
odd groupings of files in ways that just aren&rsquo;t possible with a mouse but 
are child&rsquo;s play when done with commands.
</p><p>
To this end, the command-line interpreter needs a Unix-style grep (global 
regular-expression parser) facility. The grep commands can flag lines of 
input filenames that match a pattern and copy them to another file. Of course, 
to be really useful, the improved Mac file manager would have to include 
many (if not most) of the techniques used in Unix to keep track of files, 
filenames, and directories. The file manager would also need things 
like wild-card character support, so groups of files could be manipulated together.
</p><p>
The future Mac operating system shouldn&rsquo;t become a Unix kernel with Mac 
window dressing, however. If Apple is going to maintain its competitive 
edge and protect its intellectual property, it makes more sense for the 
Mac operating system to incorporate the kinds of file management capabilities 
I&rsquo;ve hinted at here, without resorting to simply &ldquo;Macifying&rdquo; 
Unix. What I&rsquo;m arguing for is a maturation of the Mac file interface by 
including features that are common to today&rsquo;s Unix and OS/2 interfaces, 
the most important of which is the command-line shell.
</p><p>
One way to extend current command-line shell interfaces would be with the 
improved use of sound. While a Sound Finder has been rumored to be under 
development by Apple for years, I don&rsquo;t think the use of sound needs to 
go far to become much more effective than it is now. For example, Farallon&rsquo;s 
Mac-Recorder has shown just how effective it is to link short sound bites 
(like quick notes or file descriptions) to files containing other information. 
Imagine how much more informative it would be if, in the Finder, you could 
click on a file you&rsquo;d just created and add a short spoken note to it, 
a note that could be replayed at any time.
</p><p>
Suppose you have a partially complete C program that a colleague is going to 
take a look at to help you fix an incorrect algorithm. With the new sound 
capabilities of the Finder, you could first append an auditory note that plays 
when the file is opened, telling your colleague where to look for the 
bad algorithm. In just a few spoken sentences, you could convey more 
information in that note than you can with a filename or with written 
comments, because your voice projects inflections and emphasis that written 
comments lack.
</p><p>
This use of voice annotation is just one way the Finder&rsquo;s management of 
sound resources could be improved. With the availability of better sound 
compression and digitization techniques, the increased use of special 
digital sound-processor chips, and the drop in price of very large hard 
disk drives and read/write optical disk drives, I have every confidence 
that the hardware necessary for successful sound management on a Mac will 
soon be in place.
</p><p>
Did you ever wish you could tile all your Finder windows with a quick 
Desktop command, or automatically overlap them, or reduce them to icons and 
sweep them into the corners of your screen? And what about resizing windows 
in any direction? Why is the Finder limited to a single resizing handle in 
the bottom right corner of a window?
</p><p>
While the current Macintosh interface does a creditable job of window 
management, there&rsquo;s significant room for improvement. Overall, the 
windowing interface should be more flexible, offer more configuration 
options, and be controllable from the new command-line shell window.
</p><p>
Specifically, with a command-line shell window, you could write special window 
scripts (since no command-line interface is worthy of the name if it 
doesn&rsquo;t have its own script language) that could invoke different 
kinds of windows based on their purpose and environment. Software 
authors could write programs to invoke a particular style of window, 
but you could override their choices. Once again, the key improvement 
is configurability.
</p><p>
A lot of little things have always bugged me about the Mac interface. Why 
can&rsquo;t I change the fonts (or sizes, or styles) in the menu bar or 
in the application menu without having to resort to using someone&rsquo;s 
shareware utility? Why can&rsquo;t I throw away the menu items I don&rsquo;t 
need from the Desktop or from any application? Why can&rsquo;t I resize icons 
or get rid of them altogether (without switching to a &ldquo;Name&rdquo; 
view)? Why can&rsquo;t I &ndash; well, you get the idea.
</p><p>
When you&rsquo;ve used the Mac for as long as I have, you develop a number 
of pet peeves. I would categorize these as general operational improvements. 
I&rsquo;m sure Apple has a bunch of these kinds of suggestions squirreled 
away, given all the market research the company does. It&rsquo;s time to pull 
them out and see which ones would really improve the Macintosh interface.
</p><p>
Finally, we come to development and user integration. All the changes I&rsquo;ve 
suggested in this piece are worthless unless MPW/MacApp provides developer 
support for them. All modifications made to the Macintosh interface need 
to permeate through third-party applications, rather than appear 
just on the Desktop.
</p><p>
I hope Apple is working on the next-generation Macintosh operating system 
and that it includes some of the improvements I&rsquo;ve outlined here. Given 
Apple&rsquo;s responsive nature in the past and its commitment to the 
extension of the Macintosh computing metaphor, I&rsquo;d be surprised if we 
don&rsquo;t start seeing some of these improvements before too long.
