The LISA project &ndash; even the mention of its
existence sent rumors throughout the computing
industry. But where and how did it all begin? Who
were the men behind the machine?
</p><p>
Silicon Valley, the geographical cluster of electronics firms 40 miles south of San Francisco, is 
a fairly small community and, as with most small towns, gossip and rumor are important elements of 
society. There is never-ending curiosity about precisely what one&rsquo;s neighbor is doing &ndash; what 
products are under development and what new technologies are on their way to market. But probably the 
longest-running bit of drama in recent Silicon Valley history has revolved around &ldquo;LISA,&rdquo; a 
secret housed in the scatter of modern, earth-toned buildings that comprise Apple Computer&rsquo;s 
headquarters in Cupertino.
</p><p>
LISA, the ultra-friendly, long-awaited addition to the Apple product line (for more details, see 
Hardware of the Month, page 181), attracted far more attention than did the development of the 
average new computer. For more than two years, stories about the project have circulated &ndash; focused 
around the notion that this would be the company&rsquo;s breakthrough product for the 1980s, intended to 
do for office systems what the original Apple did for the entire field of personal computing.
</p><p>
On that count, only time will tell. But the LISA project did produce a remarkable machine, and the 
collective nature of its invention is a process worth examining.
</p><p>

His mission as one of the guiding forces of LISA was to develop the prototype computer of the 1980&rsquo;s.</td></tr></table>
John Couch, the rangy, energetic head of the personal office systems group at Apple, arrived 
from Hewlett-Packard in 1978 &ndash; at half his previous salary, but with an exciting assignment: 
to produce a strategy for the company&rsquo;s future personal-computing software. &ldquo;To spec out 
the personal computer of the 1980s,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;To ask, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s going to be 
the next Apple II?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p><p>
The first part of the answer was clear: The next great advance would take place in computers for the office, 
simply because that&rsquo;s where the resources are to purchase sophisticated technology. Couch recalls 
sitting around in the office of Steven Jobs, Apple&rsquo;s co-founder and now chairman, &ldquo;with our 
feet up on the desk, thinking about what directions to go in. What we said was that we wanted to replace 
everything in his office &ndash; but we didn&rsquo;t want to change the way people did things.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The second part of the answer was Couch&rsquo;s feeling that the next major step forward would lie in a 
software revolution, rather than a hardware evolution. Couch became vice president of software and, during 
a period when all of Apple&rsquo;s development projects were given women&rsquo;s names, launched LISA. (Most 
code names are dropped when projects reach the market, but LISA fit the human dimensions of the 
machine so well that the name stuck. At the last minute, a suitable acronym, Local Integrated Software 
Architecture, was reverse-engineered to fit the name.)
</p><p>
Couch recalls that one guiding principle for LISA came from his own father, whom he&rsquo;d watched using a 
TRS-80 Microcomputer to run his health club. Every time Couch visited him, his father needed more 
programming to simplify his work. Couch realized that the machine could be made much easier to use 
if it integrated all the applications to begin with. At the time he was still working for 
Hewlett-Packard. &ldquo;They thought it was a good idea,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and wanted to put 
it in a $100,000 machine.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Thus LISA began with a fairly broad mandate: There was a general sense that the machine should 
be office-oriented, powerful, and easy to use. But no one was quite sure how to do it.
</p><p>

At first, ideas about the user interface &ndash; just how people would control the machine &ndash; involved 
then-current concepts like &ldquo;soft&rdquo; function keys (which have subsequently appeared in a 
number of other personal computers), says Bruce Daniels, one of the project&rsquo;s earliest software designers 
back when the entire LISA staff &ndash; soon to swell to over 200 people &ndash; could still fit in a 
few offices behind a nearby health food restaurant. No one was satisfied, however, and the 
entire question of how to proceed remained up in the air until December 1979.
</p><p>
That month, a small group of Apple engineers, intrigued by some
published papers, traveled a few miles north to the Xerox research center in Palo Alto to see 
a demonstration of a new language system called Smalltalk. Smalltalk was unusually friendly and made 
extensive use of a hand-controlled &ldquo;mouse,&rdquo; rather than a keyboard, to move the cursor on 
the screen. &ldquo;We loved it &ndash; what they were trying to put across in ease of use,&rdquo; says 
Daniels. &ldquo;It was almost a snap at that point. We all said, That&rsquo;s it &ndash; that&rsquo;s what we 
want to build.&rsquo;&rdquo;

A young Xerox researcher named Larry Tessler [sic] gave the Smalltalk demonstration. &ldquo;I was about 
the only person there interested in personal computers,&rdquo; he recalls, &ldquo;so they said, &lsquo;You can 
talk to these people from Apple.&rsquo;&rdquo; As it turned out, Tessler liked the Apple folks. In fact, 
six months later he joined the LISA project engineers, who just then were in the throes of designing the 
user interface.
</p><p>
By then a lot had already happened with the project: The decision to go with the mouse approach had 
taken three months, and three months after that there was a prototype machine. &ldquo;(There were) 
breadboards, wires, all over the floor,&rdquo; says Daniels. &ldquo;But it worked, and nobody got 
electrocuted.&rdquo; The decision-making process surrounding the hardware &ndash; which processor, how many circuit
boards &ndash; had been relatively brief by industry standards. But the next phase, the design of 
the user interface &ndash; the aspect of the project on which LISA would rise or fall &ndash; proved more trying.
</p><p>
A variety of mock-ups were built, and basic software decisions were made. The summer of 1980 saw such 
concepts as pull-down menus, scroll bars, and what came to be known as &ldquo;cut-and-paste&rdquo; 
procedures &ndash; all sophisticated uses of the cursor plus the mouse to replace keyboard input. Each 
change in the interface was subjected to great scrutiny, says Daniels, &ldquo;even the question of how many 
buttons to have on the mouse.&rdquo;
</p><p class=caption>
Make it simple
</p><p>
The mouse question reflects a basic approach of the LISA team. &ldquo;In any situation when there were arguments 
in both directions, unless one approach was a big advantage for experienced users, we&rsquo;d choose the one 
that made it easier for the beginner,&rdquo; says Tessler. &ldquo;In this case, we found that two 
buttons on the mouse were a slight advantage for experienced users, but not much. For beginners, when there 
were two buttons, they&rsquo;d keep glancing down. With one button, they adapted right away. Since we 
had a very aggressive target &ndash; being able to learn the system in less than a half hour &ndash; we 
couldn&rsquo;t have 20 minutes of getting over your fear of the mouse.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty much how we spent the first year,&rdquo; Daniels says, &ldquo;coming up with ideas, 
trying them out, finding the problems, and trying something new.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Designing a new user interface meant sampling a lot of users. Most tests were run on new Apple 
employees &ndash; they would be screened for previous computer experience, and a screened list would be 
delivered to the LISA group weekly. &ldquo;Then if I was working on the spreadsheet,&rdquo; Tessler 
says, &ldquo;I could say, &lsquo;I want two managers and three accounting clerks with no computer 
experience.&rsquo; Or else I could request a similar group, except that they&rsquo;d all used 
VisiCalc before.&rdquo; Hundreds of hours of observation ensued, supervised by psychologists, and 
much of it videotaped.
</p><p>
By the fall of 1980 the user interface was basically agreed on. Only then did the LISA group meet 
with Apple&rsquo;s marketing people to decide which application would be developed for first release. 
Initially, five were chosen &ndash; such basic functions as word processing, graphics, financial 
modeling. Then programming started in earnest. Within three months nearly 20 new programmers were hired, 
with an average of 10 years experience each. &ldquo;They came from all over the country, from places 
with all kinds of styles,&rdquo; Tessler says. &ldquo;There was a period of learning to live together, 
and then we got to work.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The first rough versions of application packages were ready by the summer of 1981. &ldquo;They were 
buggy,&rdquo; Tessler says, &ldquo;but at least you could sit down and play with them to get 
a sense of the user interface.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Then came perhaps the most difficult task: integrating the application packages so that data could go back 
and forth, and text could be cut and pasted between operations in much the same fashion that John 
Couch had envisioned for his father. And all
of this would have to run smoothly under one on-screen display called the Desktop Manager.
</p><p>
Something interesting happened in this process. The job proved sufficiently massive and involved so 
many interdependent tasks that the LISA team began drawing PERT (Performance Evaluation and Review 
Technique) charts to track the various aspects of the project. The weekly updating of the charts 
grew tiresome, however, and it wasn&rsquo;t long before a program was written to do the job on the 
embryonic LISA.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Suddenly everyone got excited,&rdquo; Tessler remembers, &ldquo;and wanted to make it another official 
application package. At first, marketing was against it, until they saw it, and then they wanted to 
use it, too.&rdquo; Within a week the &ldquo;LISA project&rdquo; program was part of the product line, and 
it was only later that market studies were done to confirm that it would, indeed, be welcome in 
the world at large.
</p><p>
Not everything occurred so quickly for LISA. In fact, in terms of industry gossip, probably the most 
talked-about aspect of the project was its scheduling. &ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s been leaked from day one,&rdquo; 
Daniels says, &ldquo;the general perception has been that it&rsquo;s horribly behind schedule.&rdquo;
</p><p>

LISA was indeed long in arriving, and probably no one was more aware of that than Wayne Rosing, a 
soft-spoken, serious fellow who came from Digital Equipment Corp. to become director of engineering for 
LISA. &ldquo;When I arrived in September 1980,&rdquo; Rosing says, &ldquo;LISA was supposed to ship in March 
1981. In fact, when I was interviewing for the job, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should say what I 
thought of that. I just indicated that I thought it was a little optimistic.&rdquo;
</p><p>
LISA, of course, has now appeared almost two years after that original date. Some companies might not have 
been so tolerant. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve had great support from top management,&rdquo; Rosing says. &ldquo;You 
can&rsquo;t just schedule an invention of this complexity. If we&rsquo;d been forced to sign up to meet 
a date, we would have had to say, &lsquo;No more invention, no more innovation.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p><p>
But surely there was some pressure to produce a product?
</p><p>
&ldquo;Sure, there were some very tough, brutal moments,&rdquo; says Rosing, &ldquo;but they were between me 
and top management. Their concern, of course, was, &lsquo;Are we just iterating to make it more and 
more elegant, and will we ever stop?&rsquo; I&rsquo;d try to explain the situation and then come back to the 
project and change as little as possible...&rdquo;
</p><p>
In addition, Daniels points out, many projects are dictated by specific market pressures &ndash; having to get 
a computer out in order to compete with a similar product. &ldquo;For us, most of the pressure 
was internal,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We wanted to get the machine out so people could use and 
appreciate it, so we&rsquo;d push ourselves. We&rsquo;d set &lsquo;best-case&rsquo; schedules.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Best-case,&rdquo; Tessler adds, &ldquo;sometimes meant totally unrealistic.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The most depressing period of the project occurred during the integration of all the applications under 
the Desktop Manager. Completion of a crucial mechanism for allowing the applications to share a 
programming code took far longer than was expected. &ldquo;That was about a year ago,&rdquo;
Rosing recalls. &ldquo;We needed a major miracle, and it wasn&rsquo;t there &ndash; the project was slipping 
faster than the calendar.&rdquo; Work continued on polishing the user interface, but, says 
Rosing, &ldquo;There are times when you go to top management and say, &lsquo;The shipping date has been 
moved forward again.&rsquo; And you never know when the boom will drop.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The boom didn&rsquo;t drop, and by the end of July 1982 all the application packages were running simultaneously 
under the Desktop Manager &ndash; the user could easily move from one to the other. It was a milestone, and 
the generally serious-minded LISA team celebrated with a champagne party. After sufficient champagne 
had been consumed, a handful of engineers decided to go back to the office and try the cut-and-paste technique 
that would allow material to be moved between applications. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to work 
yet,&rdquo; Tessler says. &ldquo;We figured it would take another couple of weeks to get it debugged. But 
they got it working that night. And since people were still hanging around, we had 
another champagne party.&rdquo;
</p><p>
After those two milestones, the nature of the software work changed. &ldquo;Debugging and performance 
improvement,&rdquo; says Daniels. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the part of the project that&rsquo;s not as (much) 
fun. Getting something up on the screen &ndash; that&rsquo;s fun. But spending hours fixing bugs and making 
things run a little faster &ndash; that&rsquo;s not so exciting.&rdquo;
</p><p class=caption>
A worst-case analysis
</p><p>
But it was necessary, and it became even more so in light of another event in the life of the 
Apple company. In the midst of the LISA development project &ndash; in June 1980 &ndash; Apple introduced the 
Apple III in a version so thoroughly rife with problems that an avalanche of bad publicity ensued. In 
turn, extra pressure was placed on the LISA team to produce a solid product. By early 1981, for example, 50
usable LISAs had already been built for the software developers. At that point, however, Rosing insisted 
that the machines be put through a complete worst-case analysis &ndash; &ldquo;timing, temperature, 
logic-loading, everything,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And then we basically started a redesign.&rdquo; Several more 
versions were produced in &ldquo;interim builds,&rdquo; with the design improved each time for factors such 
as safety and manufacturability. It was not until February 1982 that a LISA close to its current 
state was produced.
</p><p>
Similar caution went into software testing. &ldquo;The review process is set up,&rdquo; Rosing 
says, &ldquo;so that we know there are 1165 bugs in an application as of such and such a date &ndash; and 
that&rsquo;s 1165 bugs that somebody&rsquo;s <i>watching,</i> and we <i>have</i> to fix.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In a sense, the ideas for LISA&rsquo;s innovative hardware and software developed rapidly in 1980. &ldquo;The 
inspiration came quickly,&rdquo; says Tessler. &ldquo;The perspiration took a lot longer.&rdquo;
</p><p>
One exception was the exact format of the Desktop Manager &ndash; the program that provides the environment 
in which the user manipulates the cursor to choose among applications. There had been early problems 
with its design, and, to compound these problems, in June 1981 Xerox introduced its Star workstation at 
a computer show in Houston. The machine was also very user-friendly, and it was heavily influenced 
by Smalltalk. &ldquo;A lot of people from Apple went there,&rdquo; says Tessler, &ldquo;and in a way it was 
like seeing Smalltalk the year before, in terms of inspiration.&rdquo; The Xerox machine relied strongly on 
graphic symbols &ndash; icons, in the jargon &ndash; to organize its functions.
</p><p>
After mulling it over for nearly nine months, the Apple team decided to go with icons as well, which were 
integrated into the system only at the last minute. The icons are small drawings of symbolic 
objects &ndash; a file cabinet or a wastebasket, for
example &ndash; arranged in a column at the right edge of the screen. Characteristically for the 
LISA project, even the shape of the icons went through various versions; different artists did 
renderings, and long discussions ensued as to whether the icons should be graphically elegant 
or simply as understandable as possible. (Also characteristically, the understandable version 
won out.) &ldquo;In a way,&rdquo; says Rosing, &ldquo;the shape of the icons are like the whole 
product &ndash; you can&rsquo;t point at something and say, &lsquo;So-and-so did that; it&rsquo;s all his.&rsquo; 
Every part of the system has a lot of people who contributed to it in various ways.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The mouse, the icons &ndash; clearly, Xerox had a lot to do with LISA. And while the (two) 
products may ultimately be in the same marketplace, the Apple design team reports friendly relationships 
with the people at Xerox. &ldquo;I think that they see the fact that we&rsquo;re doing something like their 
product as giving them more credibility,&rdquo; says Tessler, the former Xerox researcher. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t 
be the only ones on the market with a bitmapped screen, a mouse, and icons, and so they&rsquo;ve encouraged us.&rdquo;
</p><p>
LISA also provided another point of interest within Apple. From the beginning, the LISA project 
was segregated from the rest of Apple. &ldquo;The LISA group wasn&rsquo;t designed to fit in,&rdquo; says 
Daniels. &ldquo;It was placed in another building, far away from the others. It was supposed to 
be revolutionary, so it wasn&rsquo;t constrained by having to share older technology.&rdquo; At first
&ndash; particularly in 1980, when a whole set of new programmers were hired at the same time &ndash; the 
LISA group had a bit of a set-apart, new-kid-on-the-block, privileged image among the rest of the 
people at Apple. &ldquo;There was skepticism,&rdquo; Tessler says. &ldquo;What are all these guys doing in 
that big building?&rdquo; But this dissolved rapidly, he says, when the rest of Apple began to see 
the early fruits of the project. And by now LISA has thoroughly become part of the Apple
culture. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; Daniels says, &ldquo;for three years, the sales of Apple IIs and IIIs 
supported us; now other people are looking forward to us contributing to their research and development.&rdquo;

What vacation?
</p><p>
On a crisp California afternoon, Rosing, Tessler, and Daniels were sitting in a small conference room 
in one of the two large building now given over entirely to LISA and the personal office system 
division. They seemed relaxed, but they were clearly looking forward to less intense times. LISA, 
in retrospect, was a massive project representing more than 200 total man-years in development &ndash; compared 
to 25 for the Apple II and two for the Apple III. And much of that effort went into painstaking 
software work. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the largest software project ever undertaken for a single 
microprocessor on behalf of one user,&rdquo; says Rosing. In scope, it was closer to the kind of effort 
that produces minicomputers like the VAX &ndash; $100,000 machines that serve numerous users at a time.
</p><p>
Bruce Daniels mentions that he has now accumulated his maximum possible vacation time, and Larry Tessler 
asks, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s vacation?&rdquo; But director Rosing is clearly sensitive about 
this. &ldquo;<i>Soul of a New Machine,</i> the prize-winning book about the development of a 
minicomputer (Avon Books, 1982),&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;created a vision that that&rsquo;s how engineering 
is done &ndash; crazy, intense efforts. But that&rsquo;s partly because in that case, someone 
else had introduced a product and Data General was behind and had to get out a product to match. We&rsquo;ve 
never had a policy about not taking vacations. People will be working over Thanksgiving, say &ndash; the door 
will be open &ndash; but it&rsquo;s up to them. Sometimes during the project two guys would take a 
machine home and work day and night for a week, but you can&rsquo;t keep that up.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Looking back, it appears that the
LISA project produced an unusual kind of group effort &ndash; one set up by Rosing to use only as 
much structure as was necessary. (Neither Tessler nor Daniels can recall what their official titles are 
supposed to be.) For example, Daniels says, specifications for LISA software started out to be very 
detailed &ndash; 50 or 100 pages. By the end, they were brief and informal; the last set, for a 
terminal emulator, was two pages. &ldquo;In the beginning, we just knew it was going to be an 
exciting office product, with graphics, and easy to use. After a year,&rdquo; Daniels says, &ldquo;everyone agreed 
on what LISA represented &ndash; the next level of subtlety.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;There was no guiding genius,&rdquo; Rosing says, &ldquo;only a guiding vision, a shared 
dream.&rdquo; A visitor remarked that it sounds similar to a successful motion-picture crew &ndash; during 
the shooting, no one knows in every detail precisely how the film will turn out. But everyone, 
from costumer to cameraman, knows intuitively what&rsquo;s right for the picture. &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; 
says Tessler. &ldquo;In fact, on LISA, people <i>had</i> to have a sense of where we were going, because they 
were pretty much self-directed for a long time. Some people worked for nearly two years before they saw 
the whole package play together.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Now, however, the package is put together. In the fall of 1982, sneak previews, mostly for potential 
corporate clients, had already begun in an elegantly furnished conference room at Apple headquarters, 
with three LISAs concealed behind an electric screen that moved aside dramatically. Early reaction had 
been very positive, and the LISA team seemed pleased &ndash; although much of their attention was still fastened 
on last-minute changes and plans for the immediate future. &ldquo;And of course,&rdquo; says 
Daniels, &ldquo;there are those great ideas coming that nobody knows about now &ndash; when someone wakes 
up in the middle of the night with an inspiration.&rdquo;
