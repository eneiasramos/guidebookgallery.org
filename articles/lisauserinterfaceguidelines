This document describes the Lisa user interface. It is primarily for people who 
want to develop applications for the Lisa Office System using the Toolkit, but 
may also be of use to those who just want to learn more about the Lisa interface.
</p><p>
The Lisa user interface is the common part of the ways in which the user and 
the Lisa applications interact. The version of the interface described in this 
document is the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; version. Usually, but by no means always, it 
matches the way the applications already released behave. However, there are 
many deviations from this standard in these applications. Wherever the behavior 
of an application and the behavior in this document disagree, the user should 
assume that this document describes the way we think the interface should 
behave, rather than the way it does behave.
</p><p>
Each section of this document consists of three parts:
<ol>
<li>A general description of the feature from the user&rsquo;s point of view.
<li>Under the heading <b>Details,</b> additional nitty-gritty details about the feature. 
These details are of interest only to those planning to develop applications.
<li>Under the heading <b>Implementation,</b> a brief discussion of what a developer needs 
to know in order to implement the feature. Mostly, this just tells you whether the 
feature is provided by the Toolkit, and if so, by which component. For more details, 
refer to the Lisa Applications Toolkit reference manual.
</ol>
</p><p>
A note on terminology: This document mostly doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between things 
that are done by the Toolkit and things that are done by an application that 
uses the Toolkit. Therefore, when we say &ldquo;the application does this 
or that,&rdquo; it may be that actually the Toolkit does it, but from the user&rsquo;s 
point of view, it is all done by the application. The only place where the distinction 
between the application and the Toolkit is relevant is in the Implementation sections.
</p><p>
To get the most from this document, you should be pretty familiar with the Lisa 
Office System. It is especially helpful to have learned to use LisaWrite, LisaDraw, 
and either LisaCalc or LisaGraph. Where relevant, this document takes examples from 
these and the other first release applications.
</p><p>
For those who want to become more familiar with the Office System, hands-on experience 
is essential. In addition, the following materials should be helpful:

1. Overview
</p><p>
The Lisa system is both a hardware system and a software system. This document 
describes the software interface; a brief description of the hardware is 
in Appendix A.
</p><p class=subcaption>
1.1. Interface design principles 
</p><p>
The Lisa user interface was designed with the following principles in mind:
<ol>
<li>It is easy to learn and to remember because the basic operations are natural 
and intuitive. They are natural because they resemble things people do when they 
aren&rsquo;t using computers, and they are intuitive because they work the 
way people would expect without giving it much thought. For example, when the user 
moves the mouse around, the pointer moves so quickly and conforms so closely to 
the path of the mouse that the user is not really aware of the steps that 
intervene between the mouse movement and the pointer movement. If the &ldquo;reaction 
time&rdquo; of the pointer were much slower, the user would be aware of the 
delay, and mouse movement would seem less intuitive.
<li>It is consistent among applications. Whenever two applications do the same thing, 
they tend to do it in the same way.
<li>It is rich enough to fit many types of applications. Currently, the 
applications available include text-oriented applications (LisaWrite), graphics-oriented 
applications (LisaDraw and LisaProject), table-oriented applications (LisaList 
and LisaCalc) and one graphics-table hybrid (LisaGraph). More categories, 
particularly forms, will be added later.
<li>It is friendly and permissive. Whenever possible, the system tries to 
put a logical interpretation on user actions.
</ol>
</p><p>
The most important principle for creating a permissive user interface is the 
abolition of modes.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
1.1.1. Modes
</p><p>
A mode is a state of the system that the user has to formally begin and end, and 
that restricts the operations he can perform while it is in effect. Experience has 
shown that it is hard for users, especially naive users, to learn and to 
use mode-based systems because of the number of arbitrary operations they have to memorize.
</p><p>
We have avoided modes in the Lisa user interface, but we haven&rsquo;t eliminated 
them entirely. We have used them wherever their value as the solution to 
a problem outweighs their inconvenience. Some examples are:
<ol>
<li>When the application sends the user an alert message warning him of a 
potentially serious problem, the user must acknowledge the message and deal 
with the problem before doing anything else. An example is entering an invalid 
formula in LisaCalc. The user must correct the formula before making
a selection outside the cell.
<li>When the cost of an operation in disk space, memory, or time is high, a mode 
can help ensure that the user&rsquo;s intentions are completely clear before
the application performs the operation. For example, in LisaList, adding or 
removing a column is a major operation because it restructures the data base. 
Therefore, the user must bring up a special table to specify the change, and 
then explicitly indicate when she is ready to add or remove the columns.
<li>Some modes are used because they correspond to the most natural way to 
do something. An example of this is the drawing modes in LisaDraw. Without 
modes, LisaDraw would not be able to give appropriate feedback while the user drew 
a free-hand curve or a straight line. To make the modes more natural, the 
metaphor of a paint palette has been introduced.
</ol>
</p><p>
Some things that might appear to be modes really aren&rsquo;t. In particular, 
toggling a global switch does not necessarily put the user in a mode. The 
criterion is whether the switch restricts what the user can do. For example, 
the Show Margin/Tab Ruler command in LisaWrite doesn&rsquo;t create a mode, 
because it doesn&rsquo;t prevent the user from doing something he could otherwise 
have done. On the other hand, Show Formulas & Values in LisaCalc is a mode 
because, when this option is in effect, the user can&rsquo;t edit cells. This 
type of mode should be avoided.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
1.1.2. Select-then-choose paradigm
</p><p>
The characteristic way of doing things in Lisa is to first select the thing 
to be operated on (usually with the mouse), then choose the appropriate menu 
item. You can think of this as &ldquo;object followed by verb.&rdquo; There are 
two exceptions to this two-step rule:
<ol>
<li>Things that you do directly with the mouse, not with a menu item. Example: 
moving an icon from one part of the desktop to another.
<li>Menu items that operate on something other than the current selection. These 
are usually items that affect the whole active document. Example: The Type 
Style menu in LisaList and LisaCalc affects the whole document, regardless of 
what is selected as long as the document is active.
</ol>
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
1.1.3. What you see is what you get
</p><p>
Lisa applications try to match the appearance of the document on the screen 
to the way the document would look if it were printed. This principle is called 
visual fidelity, or &ldquo;what you see is what you get&rdquo; <i>(wysiwyg).</i> 
Of course, the different properties of the two media make it impossible to 
match exactly, but it is very helpful to users to match as closely as possible. 
For example, fonts are designed to look as similar as possible on the screen 
and on paper. Other features such as column width in tables, margins in 
LisaWrite, and shadings in LisaDraw are kept the same when the document is printed 
as when it is displayed on the screen. The goal is to make it unnecessary for 
the user to go through a separate formatting stage when she wants to print a document.
</p><p class=subcaption>
1.2 Basic model
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-1'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 1-1. Typical desktop' title='Figure 1-1.

Typical desktop</td></tr></table>
<a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-1'>Figure 1-1</a> shows the Lisa screen at a typical moment. The background 
of the screen is called the desktop; it is the domain of the Desktop Manager. 
On the desktop are various icons, which can be opened up to display their contents. 
Some of the icons represent documents. Right now, two documents are open; that 
is, their contents are displayed on the screen. One of these is a LisaWrite document, 
and the other is a LisaGraph document. The LisaGraph
document is the active document; you can tell because its scroll bars are gray, 
with various gadgets in them.
</p><p>
Each document belongs to a particular application; when the user activates 
the document, that application takes over from the Desktop Manager. The frame 
that the document appears in is called a window. The portion of the document 
visible in the window is called the current view, which is one area within 
the document view. The window can be thought of as a frame that is moved 
over the underlying document, bringing different portions of the document 
into view. The user moves the frame by scrolling the document, using the 
various mechanisms in the scroll bars.
</p><p>
At the top of the screen is the menu bar, which contains the menus belonging 
to the application. Menus are the primary way the user tells the application 
what operations to perform. In <a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-1'>Figure 1-1</a>, the Graph menu has been 
pulled down, and the user has chosen the Line menu item.
</p><p>
Within a window, the current view can be subdivided in various ways. For example, 
LisaGraph applications contain panels, such as the graph panel and the 
table panel. Panels usually contain different representations of the same data; in 
this case, the table panel shows the data as text, and the graph panel shows 
it as a graph. Window can also be divided into panes. Two panes
within a window show the document in the same way, but they show two different 
parts of the document. The LisaWrite document whose window appears behind 
the LisaGraph window is split into two panes.
</p><p class=subcaption>
1.3. Styles of interaction
</p><p>
The Lisa user interface has several different styles of interaction between the 
user and the application. In the first release applications, four styles can 
be identified: text, graphics, tables, and forms. Each of these styles is 
appropriate for different situations. Some applications use one style almost 
exclusively; others use different styles in different panels; still others are 
hybrids, using two or more styles simultaneously.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
1.3.1. Text
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-2'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 1-2.

LisaWrite document</td></tr></table>
The text style applies to any information the user enters from the keyboard. Text 
can be thought of as one long string of characters that is arranged in words 
and paragraphs. Nearly every application uses text somewhere; it follows the same 
rules in every context in which it occurs.
</p><p>
<a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-2'>Figure 1-2</a> shows a window containing a typical text document (from 
LisaWrite). Terms applicable to text are illustrated in the figure. These terms 
are discussed later in this document.
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> &ndash;
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> In the Toolkit, text is supported by the Text building 
block. Text that is copied or moved between applications is supported by the 
Universal Text Interface building block.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
1.3.2. Graphics
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-3'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 1-3.

LisaDraw document</td></tr></table>
The graphics style is used for information that is conveyed through pictures 
rather than words. In some products, such as LisaDraw, the user draws pictures 
using the mouse; in others, such as the Desktop Manager, the user manipulates pictures 
drawn by the application. A graphics application can be thought of as a 
collection of objects that are either separate or arranged in groups. A separate 
object can be operated on without affecting any of the other objects.
</p><p>
A graphics object is either a geometrical shape (as in LisaDraw) or a bit 
map (as in the Desktop Manager).
</p><p>
<a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-3'>Figure 1-3</a> shows a window containing a typical graphics document (from LisaDraw).
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> A geometrically defined object can be scaled more smoothly than 
a bit map, but a bit map object can show finder detail.
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> In the Toolkit, geometrically defined objects are supported 
by the Structured Graphics building block, and bit map graphics are supported by 
the Bit Map graphics building block. Quickdraw is also available for custom graphics.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
1.3.3. Tables
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-4'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 1-4.

LisaCalc document</td></tr></table>
Tables show data arranged in a rectangular array of rows and columns. The 
individual unit in the array is a cell. (This is called a field in LisaList 
documentation.) A cell is a box that may or may not contain a value. Some
operations are performed on cells, others on values.  The value in a cell is a
text string that can contain several paragraphs, or be limited by the application to 
a single one-line paragraph.
</p><p>
<a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-4'>Figure 1-4</a> shows a window containing a typical table document (from LisaCalc).
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> Currently, no application supports more than one paragraph in a cell.                         
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> &ndash;
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
1.3.4. Forms
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-5'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 1-5.

Print dialog box</td></tr></table>
A form is a request for information that the application makes to the user. 
It consists of a fixed arrangement of text fields, check boxes, and buttons. 
The user provides the requested information by filling in the fields and 
creating the boxes. A form is therefore more restrictive than the other styles 
in the range of operations the user can do. A dialog box is an example of a form.
</p><p>
<a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-5'>Figure 1-5</a> shows a window containing a typical form (from the printing dialog box).
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> &ndash;
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> In the Toolkit, forms are supported by the Dialog building block.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
1.3.5. Hybrids
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-6'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 1-6.

Form letter</td></tr></table>
The four styles of interaction can be combined in various ways. One obvious
way is that cells in tables and fields in forms both contain text. Once the
cell or field has been selected, the text in it can be edited just like any other
text.
</p><p>
Another hypothetical example would be a word processor that had a form
letter feature. In an application like this, each document is a form with text
superimposed on it (<a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/1-6'>Figure 1-6</a>). The blank spaces in the letter are actually
fields in the form. To complete the letter, the user fills in the blank fields
in the form. The result is a letter that is indistinguishable from one that was
typed from start to finish.

5. Desktop Manager
</p><p>
Filing operations are covered in the Lisa Owner&rsquo;s Guide; this section gives 
some details about the relationship between an application and the Desktop Manager.
</p><p class=subcaption>
5.1. General scheme
</p><p>
Some applications limit the size of a document to one whose contents can be 
kept in memory at the same time (for example, LisaCalc). In these applications, any 
changes the user makes to the document are kept in memory. When the user saves 
the document, the changes are made to the document on the disk. If the user chooses 
Revert to Previous Version, the changes are nullified.
</p><p>
In other applications, the user can create documents that are too large to fit into 
memory (for example, LisaList). In this case, the application keeps a file containing 
the changes to the document. When the user saves the document, the application updates 
it based on the material in the change file.
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> &ndash;
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> The Toolkit implements all Desktop Manager operations on 
the assumption that the application is following the LisaCalc model (whole document 
in memory). If it instead follows the LisaList model or some other model, the 
application must redefine certain methods to specify supplementary behavior.
</p><p class=subcaption>
5.2. Desktop Manager operations
</p><p>
This section covers those aspects of Desktop Manager operations that the application 
needs to know about.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.1. Activate
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/8'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 8. Active LisaCalc document' title='Figure 8. Active LisaCalc document' src='pics/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/8.gif'></a></td></tr><tr><td class=imagecaption><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/8'><img border=0 align=right width=12 height=12 alt='This image can be zoomed' title='This image can be zoomed' style='margin-top: 3px; margin-left: 5px' src='intr/zoom.gif'></a>Figure 8. Active LisaCalc document</td></tr></table>
The active window is the one the user is currently working on. At most one 
window on the desktop can be active at a time.
</p><p>
A window becomes active in one of the following ways:
<ol>
<li>The user opens the document when it is closed. To open the document, the 
user either clicks twice on its icon, or chooses Open from the File menu when the 
icon is selected.
<li>The user clicks in the document&rsquo;s window when it is deactivated (see 
section 5.2 for deactivation). The window is exactly the same as it was when 
the user deactivated it, including the current selection and the position of the 
document within the window.
</ol>
</p><p>
An active LisaCalc document is shown in <a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/8'>Figure 8</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> When a window is active, it has the following characteristics:
<ol>
<li>Scroll bars are shown in the window.
<li>The title bar is highlighted.
<li>The application's menus are in the menu bar.
</ol>
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> Automatic in the Toolkit.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.2. Deactivate
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/9'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 9. Deactivated LisaCalc document' title='Figure 9. Deactivated LisaCalc document' src='pics/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/9.gif'></a></td></tr><tr><td class=imagecaption><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/9'><img border=0 align=right width=12 height=12 alt='This image can be zoomed' title='This image can be zoomed' style='margin-top: 3px; margin-left: 5px' src='intr/zoom.gif'></a>Figure 9. Deactivated LisaCalc document</td></tr></table>
The user deactivates a window by clicking outside of it. When she does this, 
the document stays just as it is; the application does not ask her to finish 
doing anything. When the user reactivates the window, the application picks up 
where it left off.
</p><p>
A deactivated LisaCalc document is shown in <a href='articles/lisauserinterfaceguidelines/pics/9'>Figure 9</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> When the user deactivates a window, the display changes in the following ways:
<ol>
<li>The scroll bar portion of the window is shown in white.
<li>The title bar is no longer highlighted.
<li>If a selection is visible in the window, it is highlighted with a gray pattern 
rather than in inverse video.
<li>The menus for the application disappear from the menu bar.
</ol>
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> Automatic in the Toolkit. The Toolkit provides a gray 
pattern for dim highlighting, but the application can use its own patter if 
it wants. Alternatively, it can make the dim highlighting look like a regular 
selection or like a deselection if necessary for aesthetic reasons.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.3. Set Aside
</p><p>
When the user sets aside an open document, the Desktop Manager deactivates it, 
and its window is shrunk back to the original icon. Just as with a deactivation, 
the state of the document remains unchanged, so that when the user opens it 
again, he can pick up where he left off.
</p><p>
To set aside a document, the user chooses Set Aside from the File/Print menu. If 
the user double-clicks on the icon in the left side of the title bar, one of 
two things happens:
<ol>
<li>If the document was on the desktop the last time she opened it, it is set aside.
<li>If the document was in a container (disk or folder) the last time she opened 
it, the Desktop Manager puts up an alert message, asking her whether she wants the 
document to be set aside or put away. (This may go away.)
</ol>
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> When a document is set aside, the application does not post 
edits to the document&rsquo;s save file, so that if the user opens the document 
again and chooses Revert to Previous Version, the document reverts to the last version 
that he saved. 
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> &ndash;
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.4. Save & Continue
</p><p>
Save & Continue saves all changes to the document without closing its window. 
The appearance of the window, including the current position and selection, 
remain unchanged.
</p><p>
Some applications, such as LisaList, save documents at times other than when 
the user has explicitly saved them from the File/Print menu. If it is necessary 
for an application to do this, it should warn the user that this is happening.
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> &ndash;
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> By default, an active document has two files associated with 
it: The Save file, written to only when the document is saved, and the Suspend 
file, which contains the document heap and which is swapped out from time to 
time. Saving the document deletes the Suspend file.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.5. Save & Put Away
</p><p>
Save & Put Away can happen in one of three ways:
<ol>
<li>If the window is open, and the user chooses Save & Put Away, the Desktop 
Manager deactivates the document, saves its contents, and returns its icon 
to the location of its ghost. It then returns the icon to the container it 
was in most recently.
<li>If the user has set aside the document on the desktop, and then chooses 
Save & Put Away, the Desktop Manager saves the contents or the document 
on the container it was in most recently.
<li>If the user has set aside the document on the desktop, and he moves its 
icon to a container, the Desktop Manager saves the contents of the document 
on that container.
</ol>
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> Some tools (eg. LisaCalc and LisaList) must do some end 
processing and consistency checks before a document can be put away. If 
the document is put away when its window is closed, the Desktop Manager 
issues an alert message telling the user that the document must be put 
away when it is open. The application also issues an alert message if there 
are I/O errors or not enough disk space.
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> An application keeps a flag called &ldquo;fCanPutBack&rdquo; 
[???] to indicate whether putting away the document could cause invalid 
data. If this flag is false, then the Desktop Manager puts up an alert 
message; otherwise, it puts away the document as instructed.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.6. Suspend
</p><p>
The Desktop Manager suspends a document that is open or set aside in the following cases:
<ol>
<li>The user turns the power off on the Lisa.
<li>The user ejects a diskette that contains the application, part of the document, 
or both.
</ol>
</p><p>
If the document is open or has been set aside, then its current state is 
frozen. When the user subsequently reopens it, it should appear exactly the 
same as before. If the user has saved and put away the document, a suspend 
should have no effect.
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> &ndash;
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> &ndash;
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.7. Resume from save
</p><p>
When the user reopens a document after she has saved it and put it away, 
the application restores its appearance to the way it was when it was saved. 
That is, panels are split the same way and scrolled to the same location, and 
the same selection is shown.
</p><p>
[??? &ndash; this is a change &ndash; comments?]
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> &ndash;
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> The Toolkit keeps track of splits and scrolling, even after 
a save; the application can override these settings.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.8. Resume from suspend
</p><p>
When the user powers on the Lisa after a suspend, or reinserts the disk whose 
ejection caused the suspend, the Desktop Manager restores the screen to the way 
it was when the Documents were suspended, except that no information is shown in 
the windows. Instead, in each window, a message appears telling the user to 
click in the window if he wants to see the document.
</p><p>
The window that was active when the Lisa was suspended is shown with an active 
title bar, but its menus are not in the menu bar. It has an active size control, 
but the rest of its scroll bars are shown in gray with no active elements [this 
is also a change].
</p><p>
If the user clicks in the scroll bars or title bar of a suspended window, rather 
than in the window itself, then its document becomes the active document. The 
user can resize or move it, but its contents are not displayed until the user 
clicks in the main part of the window. At that time, the document should appear 
exactly the same way it did when it was suspended.
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> If, instead of clicking in a suspended document, the user requests 
that it be put away, the document is put away by the Desktop Manager, not 
by the application, and is therefore still suspended.
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> &ndash;
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
5.2.9. Revert to Previous Version
</p><p>
Revert to Previous Version restores a document to the way it was the last 
time it was saved. Usually, this means the last time the user explicitly saved it, 
but in some applications, such as LisaList, this can mean the last time the 
application saved it.
</p><p>
If a document is not memory-resident, the application keeps changes to the document 
separate from the original version of the document, as described above (section 
5.1). If the document is memory resident, the application keeps a separate, 
unchanged copy.
</p><p>
<b>Details:</b> Suspend, deactivate, and set aside do not affect the contents of 
the current version. If the user reactivates the document and chooses Revert to 
Previous Version, the version he gets is the last one established by a save 
before the suspend, deactivate, or set aside.
</p><p>
<b>Implementation:</b> Automatic in the Toolkit for LisaCalc-style applications. 
For LisaList-style applications, the Toolkit routines are assisted by application 
methods.
