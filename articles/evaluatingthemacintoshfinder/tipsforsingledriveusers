Apple has been widely criticized for providing only one disk drive 
in the basic Macintosh. While two disk drives are definitely 
desirable, it is certainly possible to make productive use of a 
single-drive Macintosh. All it takes is attention to these techniques.
</p><p>
<b>Use separate start-up disks for each major application.</b> 
Because of the Macintosh&rsquo;s limited memory size, most 
application programs are not able to fit entirely in memory. 
Instead, the program must often go to disk, bringing in code 
and data. This requires that you keep the &ldquo;application 
disk&rdquo; (the disk containing the actual application 
program) in the disk drive nearly all of the time.
</p><p>
When you&rsquo;re ready to save the document on which you&rsquo;re 
working, the application program will typically allow you to 
eject the application disk and insert another data disk. While 
this is handy at times, it enacts a penalty of several disk swaps 
every time you save your work, and you should save it often. 
You can avoid these swaps simply by saving your work to the 
application disk.
</p><p>
To use this strategy, you need to free as much space as possible 
on your application disk to make room for your data files. At 
first, you might think that the Finder&rsquo;s system files 
(veritable disk gluttons consuming up to 230K bytes on every 
400K-byte disk) would be good candidates for elimination. No 
way. Most application programs require frequent access to these files.
</p><p>
A better idea is to create separate application disks, each 
having the system files and a single application program. For 
example, to create a separate application disk for MacPaint, make 
a copy of your original Write/Paint master disk using the Disk Copy 
utility (included in version 1.1g of the Finder). Then delete everything 
on the copy except the system files and MacPaint. You&rsquo;ll 
end up with a stand-alone MacPaint disk that can be used to 
start the computer.
</p><p>
Using this technique (and the techniques that follow) will usually leave 
you with 100K to 250K bytes of open space on each application 
disk. This should give you plenty of breathing room for 
storage. Of course, storing data on application disks is 
not very efficient. You can alleviate this problem by using 
application disks for temporary storage only; use separate data 
disks for permanent storage. When you quit an application, 
copy your document files to a separate data disk that doesn&rsquo;t 
have the system files or application program. Then you can delete 
your data on the application disk and make room for more files.
</p><p>
If you find that you frequently need to switch back and 
forth between two application programs (e.g., when you are cutting 
and pasting MacPaint images into MacWrite), you may want to have 
a disk with both applications. In this case, you&rsquo;ll probably 
have to keep your data on a separate data disk and endure the 
disk swaps every time you save the data. Try to avoid this 
if you can.
</p><p>
<b>Use the Font Mover utility.</b> The Finder stores character 
fonts (the bit maps that define the shape of each character) 
in the System file. Because these images take up quite a bit 
of disk space (138K bytes in version 1.1g) and because some users 
do not need all of the different fonts, a utility program, 
called Font Mover, is provided that allows fonts to be 
removed from the System file.
</p><p>
Deciding which fonts to keep is up to you. Keep in mind that the 
larger fonts offer the biggest rewards in disk-space savings. 
Note: certain fonts, required by the operating system, cannot 
be removed by the Font Mover program; they are Chicago-12, 
Geneva-9, Geneva-12, and Monaco-9.
</p><p>
<b>Stay in application programs as long as possible.</b> Since 
opening and quitting an application program are slow operations, do 
as much work as possible each time you run an application. For 
example, if you need to paste a number of images into a MacWrite 
document, draw all your images in one MacPaint session, storing 
them in the Scrapbook. This will reduce the number of times you 
need to open and quit an application program.
</p><p>
<b>Practice good desktop housekeeping.</b> The Finder stores 
a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; file on each disk that gives the 
current status of windows for that disk. Updating this file often 
takes a significant amount of time, especially if you are 
ejecting and inserting several disks in sequence. Speed up your 
operations by keeping the number of open windows to a minimum.
</p><p>
<b>Do all file copying at once.</b> Every time you copy a 
file from one disk to another, a few disk swaps are required. 
If possible, postpone file copying until you can do it all at 
once with one copy operation. In this way, your average number of 
swaps per file copied will decrease.
</p><p>
Don&rsquo;t forget that the Finder has two methods of selecting multiple 
files. You can drag a box around the group of files (this works 
well when the file icons are near one another), or you can 
hold down the Shift key and click each file icon in turn. When you 
have selected all the files you want to copy, drag any one to your 
copy destination. Like the Blue Angels, the entire group of files 
will fly in perfect formation across your desktop to the destination.
</p><p>
<b>Use your Scrapbook and Clipboard effectively.</b> They are 
stored as disk files. Typically, they are kept in the System folder. 
For the most part, the Finder uses the Scrapbook and Clipboard 
files on the start-up disk (the disk you used initially to boot the machine).
</p><p>
Things can get a little tricky when you start a new application 
program on another disk that also has Scrapbook and Clipboard files. 
This will cause the new application disk to become the start-up 
disk. But which files will the Finder use?
</p><p>
Actually, the Scrapbook and Clipboard behave differently. The 
Clipboard is copied from the old start-up disk to the new 
start-up disk, replacing the Clipboard file on the new disk. 
This means that the Clipboard will always stay intact even if 
you leapfrog from disk to disk as you run different applications.
</p><p>
The Scrapbook, on the other hand, is not copied. Instead, 
the Scrapbook file on the new start-up disk is pressed into 
service. Thus, each disk with a Scrapbook file essentially has its 
own Scrapbook.
</p><p>
This scheme has a pitfall. A typical scenario: you draw a number 
of images in MacPaint that you wish to paste into a MacWrite 
document. After carefully storing each image in the Scrapbook, you 
exit MacPaint. Because MacWrite is on a different disk, you eject 
the MacPaint disk, insert the MacWrite disk, and open up 
MacWrite. To your dismay, the images you have just stored have 
vanished. Where did they go?
</p><p>
They are still around, but they&rsquo;re in the Scrapbook file 
on the MacPaint disk. How do you get around this problem? 
One solution is to avoid using the Scrapbook, use the Clipboard 
instead. But this approach can be incredibly time consuming when 
you need to transfer several items because of the time it 
takes to repeatedly open and quit each application program as 
you cut and paste each image.
</p><p>
Another method is to copy the Scrapbook file from the old 
start-up disk to the new start-up disk prior to starting 
the new application program. You do this by dragging the Scrapbook 
file (in the System folder) to the new disk before starting 
the new application program.
</p><p>
<b>Use keyboard commands.</b> The Finder includes command key 
equivalents for commands that are usually selected with the 
mouse from the pop-down menus. Many times executing these 
keyboard commands can be quicker than using the mouse.
</p><p>
<b>Use the keyboard/mouse buffer.</b> The Finder buffers 
the mouse movement/clicks and keystrokes. Since many operations 
are repetitious, you can often anticipate the next step and 
place it in the buffer in order to keep the disk drive 
from stopping. The computer must wait for a stopped disk 
drive to come up to speed before you can begin reading or 
writing.
