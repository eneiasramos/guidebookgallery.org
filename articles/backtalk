What separates a successful business from a blockbuster? VisiCorp, nee Personal Software, presents 
an example of the latter. Its superstar product, <i>VisiCalc,</i> became such a hit that management decided 
to change the name of the company to reflect the product&rsquo;s name. Was this success all due only to 
the merits of a software concept whose moment had come, or was the foresight and willingness of 
the management to take risks &ndash; from the word go &ndash; also a crucial ingredient?
</p><p>
<i>Softalk</i> first introduced its readers to the VisiCorp people and their forward-thinking approach 
back in October 1980. The company was still doing business as Personal Software then. Here was a 
firm whose growth became the archetype of the Silicon Valley success story.
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/backtalk/pics/danfylstra'><img class=screenshot alt='Chairman Dan Fylstra.' title='Chairman Dan Fylstra.' width=150 height=151 src='pics/articles/backtalk/danfylstra.jpg'></a></td></tr><tr><td class=imagecaption><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/backtalk/pics/danfylstra'><img border=0 align=right width=12 height=12 alt='This image can be zoomed' title='This image can be zoomed' style='margin-top: 3px; margin-left: 5px' src='intr/zoom.gif'></a>Chairman Dan Fylstra.</td></tr></table>
VisiCorp&rsquo;s Dan Fylstra and his wife operated a software mail order operation out of their apartment 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. That was in 1978, and their product line contained many games one might 
consider collectible today, some by nature of their obscurity, others by nature of the huge 
popularity they&rsquo;ve enjoyed since they were originally released.
</p><p>
One such collectible hit program was developed by Canadian Peter Jennings, the cofounder with Fylstra of 
Personal Software, toward the end of 1978. This popular chess program, <i>Microchess,</i> along with the 
marketing savvy of Fylstra, made possible all that would follow for Personal.
</p><p>
With the success of this program under their belts, Jennings and Fylstra were in a position to
begin parlaying the company, which started with an initial investment of $500, into one whose worth 
is now appraised to run somewhere in the area of $125 million. Armed with an understanding of the 
necessity to take risks, they felt compelled in late 1978 to embark on a course of action that could 
make or break the company.
</p><p>
They decided to go for broke, funding MIT grads Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston with $100,000 worth of the 
profits from <i>Microchess</i> to develop what was envisioned to be a business forecasting tool or 
spreadsheet. The gamble paid off: <i>VisiCalc</i> became a long-running top seller, setting a standard 
that all competitors addressing the business software market would have to acknowledge.

By 1980 Personal Software had received $500,000 in private placement funds from a venture capital arm 
of the Rockefeller family, as well as all the management expertise that went along with the 
association. A few months before the Exec feature <i>Softalk</i> presented on the company in the latter 
part of 1980, Terry Opdendyk, formerly of Intel and, before that, of Hewlett-Packard, had been 
recruited to fill the position of president and chief operating officer. Jennings had begun to 
concentrate his efforts in advanced research and development, and Fylstra, now chairman of 
the board, continued to concentrate on what he then referred to as &ldquo;doing an Apple.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;We looked around the industry and liked what we saw at Apple, so we applied those elements 
of success that were germane to our business and made them our own,&rdquo; says Fylstra. One of these elements 
was, by traditional standards, the premature installation in executive positions of people that appeared 
to be over-qualified, thus allowing the company room to grow into the capabilities of its management.
</p><p>
And grow the company did. With its change of name to VisiCorp and of residence to Silicon Valley, all 
the entertainment software that was part of its line early on was eschewed in favor of a complete 
line of business packages. Every one was called VisiSomething and was supported by a full-time 
staff of more than three hundred employees.
</p><p>
In the spring of 1981, it became obvious that if hardware trends continued evolving as rapidly as they 
were, certain things would be inevitable in the area of software marketing. Fylstra says, &ldquo;One of 
our maxims is that user expectations always rise to a point just beyond what can currently be delivered.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Plans were laid to develop a series of integrated multipurpose software packages that would complement 
<i>VisiCalc</i> and take advantage of the more powerful computer systems that consumers would be buying.
</p><p>
Now, two years later, VisiCorp is about to unveil <i>VisiOn.</i> Though analogous in many ways to the 
approach taken by Apple with the Lisa, <i>VisiOn</i> is distinctively software-based, allowing it to run on 
various machines, above the level of the operating system.
</p><p>
<i>VisiOn</i> and Lisa share a distinctive window approach to interacting with various data structures and 
a mouse that makes control keys and complex command codes a thing of the past. The <i>VisiOn</i> programs opt 
for a more verbal approach to menu selection, instead of the graphic icons that Lisa provides to represent 
various tasks.
</p><p>
<i>VisiOn</i> is scheduled to be in users&rsquo; hands by October. The package will run on sixteen-bit 
machines (eight-bit machines not being powerful enough to accommodate it) and will use expanded memory and 
hard-disk-storage capabilities. The approach is modular. Each application can be purchased separately. 
The initial release will offer three core programs, <i>VisiOn Calc,</i> <i>VisiOn Word,</i> and 
<i>VisiOn Graph,</i> each integrating substantial improvements over other similar applications already 
offered in VisiCorp&rsquo;s product line.
</p><p>
In such a period of rapid technological growth as the present, when the nature of the workplace is being 
redefined by burgeoning technology, the nature of the relationship between labor and management must 
also be redefined. The awareness of this essential connection is reflected at VisiCorp in the 
share-the-wealth attitude toward employees that&rsquo;s concretely implemented in the company&rsquo;s 
profit-sharing and stock-option policies. The majority of VisiCorp stock is held by its employees in 
spite of successive founds with outside venture capital investors &ndash; a little more than nine 
million dollars&rsquo; worth &ndash; that the company has enjoyed to date. Management at VisiCorp 
stands committed to this approach that views worker participation as an essential ingredient for increased 
productivity and continued success.
</p><p>
Another solid commitment at VisiCorp, continued from the early days when Personal Software was just 
beginning in Boston, is the employ of the handicapped for product assembly. Last year VisiCorp was 
selected Handicapped Employer of the Year for the San Francisco Bay Area. The company currently employs hundreds 
of handicapped people from various organizations, including a disabled veterans&rsquo; group.
</p><p>
Looking always toward the future, Opdendyk sees the next frontier for VisiCorp to be in the area 
of communications and networking; he predicts a proliferation of local-area networks over the next few 
years. In consideration of this, all of the <i>VisiOn</i> line has the ability to communicate with mainframes 
and other micros.
</p><p>
The meteoric success of <i>VisiOn,</i> made possible by the powerhouse team of Fylstra, Opdendyk, and 
Jennings and backed by the support of those in their employ, bears witness to the viability of 
risk-taking in the area of marketing as well as in the area of organizational structure and policy. Most 
companies that endure and become giants in their fields achieve success because the motivating people who make 
the decisions are risk-takers.
</p><p>
But the nature of risks is that, sometimes, they don&rsquo;t pay off.
</p><p>
<b>Taking chances.</b> A man like Howard Hughes predicated his life on taking risks, in business and 
personally. Plenty didn&rsquo;t pay off for him, but most of the crucial ones did. Besides that eccentric 
and monumental souvenir, the Spruce Goose (flown only once, and only for moments, with Hughes himself 
in the cockpit), the giant and now diversified Hughes Aircraft Corporation remains a living monument to 
this innovator&rsquo;s risk-taking prowess. At the helm today is Dr. Allen E. Puckett, chairman of the 
board and chief executive officer. He bought himself an Apple in 1979 as a tool to help him understand 
better the implications of increased computing power on the flow of information at Hughes. <i>Softalk</i> 
told his story in September 1981.
</p><p>

Puckett, Hughes Aircraft chairman, and his son Jimmy enjoy spending time at their computer workstation at home.</td></tr></table>
At that time, Puckett had taught himself programming from the manual that came with his Apple and 
had devised some programs for his personal use to keep track of tax records and stock transactions. An 
enthusiastic yachtsman, Puckett wrote a program used in the Mazatlan Regatta to keep an up-to-the-minute account 
of each yacht in the race. The information that the program tracked, on each vessel&rsquo;s position and 
current standing, during the race kept the participants and the media who were covering the event well 
abreast of each yacht&rsquo;s progress.
</p><p>
In his position at Hughes, Puckett was preoccupied with a different kind of progress, that of adjusting 
company personnel to the electronic revolution. The chief executive officer had come to understand 
the coming computer age as an electronic triangle: data processing, data storage, and communication. &ldquo;Group 
all three and you have a totally new capability in excess of human capability,&rdquo; he said.
</p><p>
Convinced at the time that computers would never replace the necessity of human interaction &ndash; such as 
the team effort he saw as fundamental at Hughes &ndash; Puckett believed that decentralizing the job site through 
the use of personal computers at home would probably not be conducive to his company&rsquo;s progress.
</p><p>
But nowadays, things are changing. Based on his experience of having the Apple at home, Puckett 
decided to risk an experiment. At the end of last year he picked the top fifty executives at Hughes, 
most of whom had no computer experience whatsoever, and provided them with micros for their own use 
at home. Puckett hoped to enable those in management to gain a better understanding of, and communicate more 
intelligently with, the computer professionals who are shaping the information
revolution.
</p><p>
The chairman now predicts that more and more home computers may become extended workstations, operating as 
terminals networked into company mainframes. At Hughes, this would be especially apt in 
the area of software design, which absorbs an increasing amount of development time on complex engineering 
projects, such as the engineering and design of a satellite.
</p><p>
On the home front, Puckett now has an IBM pc sitting adjacent to his tried-and-true Apple. And this 
new acquisition was good news to his fourteen-year-old son, Jimmy, who&rsquo;s been writing his own 
Basic programs for some time &ndash; having another computer around gives Jimmy more uninterrupted time on the 
Apple for programming and for playing <i>Axis Assassin,</i> his current favorite. The elder Puckett 
worries about the preoccupation with game playing by Jimmy and his schoolmates, many of whom have 
Apples at home, too. Reassuringly, Jimmy praises <i>WordStar</i> for the ease with which he has applied it 
to school projects requiring word processing.
</p><p>
Whether you&rsquo;re chairman of the board or merely a fledgling hacker, the Apple you spend your time 
with can be an essential partner in your personal formula for success. It sure helps to have something 
you can rely on when venturing into uncharted territory &ndash; always a risky business.
