Abstract
</p><p>
In April 1981 Xerox announced the 8010 Star Information System, a 
new personal computer designed for office professionals who 
create, analyze, and distribute information. The Star 
user interface differs from that of other office computer systems by 
its emphasis on graphics, its adherence to a metaphor of a physical 
office, and its rigorous application of a small set of design 
principles. The graphic imagery reduces the amount of typing and 
remembering required to operate the system. The office metaphor makes 
the system seem familiar and friendly; it reduces the alien feel 
that many computer systems have. The design principles unify the 
nearly two dozen functional areas of Star, increasing the coherence of 
the system and allowing user experience in one are to apply in others.

Introduction
</p><p>
In this paper we present the features in the Star system without justifying them 
in detail. In a <a href='articles/designingthestaruserinterface'>companion 
paper</a><sup><small>1</small></sup> we discuss the 
rationale for the design decisions made in Star. We assume that the reader 
has a general familiarity with computer text editors, but no familiarity with Star.

The Star hardware consists of a processor, a two-page-wide bit-mapped display, 
a keyboard, and a cursor control device. The Star software addresses about two 
dozen functional areas of the office, encompassing document creation; data 
processing; and electronic filing, mailing, and printing. Document creation includes 
text editing and formatting, graphics editing, mathematical formula editing, and 
page layout. Data processing deals with homogeneous databases that can be sorted, 
filtered, and formatted under user control. Filing is an example of a 
network service using the Ethernet local area network.<sup><small>2,3</small></sup> 
Files may be stored on a work station&rsquo;s disk (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig1'>Figure 1</a>), on a file server 
on the work station&rsquo;s network, or on a file server on a different network. 
Mailing permits users of work stations to communicate with one another. Printing 
uses laser-driven xerographic printers capable of printing both text and graphics. 
The term <i>Star</i> refers to the total system, hardware plus software.
</p><p>
As Jonathan Seybold has written, &ldquo;This is a very different product: Different 
because it truly bridges word processing and typesetting functions; different because 
it has a broader range of capabilities than anything which has preceded it; 
and different because it introduces to the commercial market radically new concepts in 
human engineering.&rdquo;<sup><small>4</small></sup>
</p><p>
The Star hardware was modeled after the experimental Alto computer developed 
at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.<sup><small>5</small></sup> Like Alto, 
Star consists of a Xerox-developed high-bandwidth MSI processor, local disk 
storage, a bit-mapped display screen having a 72-dot-per-inch resolution, a 
pointing device called the mouse, and a connection to the Ethernet. Stars 
are higher-performance machines than Altos, being about three times as fast, 
having 512K bytes of main memory (vs. 256K bytes on most Altos), 10 or 29M bytes 
of disk memory (vs. 2.5M bytes), a 10&frac12;-by-13&frac12;-inch display 
screen (vs. a 10&frac12;-by-8&frac12;-inch one), 1024&times;808 addressable 
screen dots (vs. 606&times;808), and a 10M bits-per-second Ethernet (vs. 3M bits). 
Typically, Stars, like Altos, are linked via Ethernets to each other and 
to shared file, mail, and print servers. Communication servers connect Ethernets 
to one another either directly or over phone lines, enabling internetwork 
communication to take place. This means, for example, that from the user&rsquo;s 
perspective it is no harder to retrieve a file from a file server across 
the country than from a local one.
</p><p>
Unlike the Alto, however, the Star user interface was designed before 
the hardware or software was built. Alto software, of which there was eventually 
a large amount, was developed by independent research teams and individuals. 
There was little or no coordination among projects as each pursued its 
own goals. This was acceptable and even desirable in a research environment 
producing experimental software. But it presented the Star designers with the 
challenge of synthesizing the various interfaces into a single, 
coherent, uniform one.
</p><p class=caption>
Essential hardware
</p><p>
Before describing Star&rsquo;s user interface, we should point out that 
there are several aspects of the Star (and Alto) architecture that are 
essential to it. Without these elements, it would have been impossible 
to design a user interface anything like the present one.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Display
</p><p>
Both Star and Alto devote a portion of main memory to the bit-mapped display 
screen: 100K bytes in Star, 50K bytes (usually) in Alto. Every screen dot 
can be individually turned on or off by setting or resetting the corresponding 
bit in memory. This gives both systems substantial ability to portray graphic images.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Memory Bandwidth
</p><p>
Both Star and Alto have a high memory bandwidth &ndash; about 50 MHz, in Star. 
The entire Star screen is repainted from memory 39 times per second. This 
50-MHz video rate would swamp most computer memories, and in fact 
refreshing the screen takes about 60% of the Alto&rsquo;s memory bandwidth. 
However, Star&rsquo;s memory is double-ported; therefore, refreshing the 
display does not appreciably slow down CPU memory access. Star also has 
separate logic devoted solely to refreshing the display.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Microcoded Personal Computer
</p><p>
Both Star and Alto are personal computers, one user per machine. Therefore 
the needed memory access and CPU cycles are consistently available. Special 
microcode has been written to assist in changing the contents of memory 
quickly, permitting a variety of screen processing that would otherwise not 
be practical.<sup><small>6</small></sup>

Both Star and the Alto use a pointing device called the mouse (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig2'>Figure 
2</a>). First developed at SRI<sup><small>7</small></sup>, Xerox&rsquo;s version 
has a ball on the bottom that turns as the mouse slides over a flat 
surface such as a table. Electronics sense the ball rotation and guide a 
cursor on the screen in corresponding motions. The mouse is a &ldquo;Fitts&rsquo;s 
law&rdquo; device: that is, after some practice you can point with a mouse 
as quickly and easily as you can with the tip of your finger. The limitations 
on pointing speed are those inherent in the human nervous system.<sup><small>8,9</small></sup>
The mouse has buttons on top that can be sensed under program control. The 
buttons let you point to and interact with objects on the screen in a variety of ways.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Local Disk
</p><p>
Every Star and Alto has its own rigid disk for local storage of programs and 
data. Editing does not require using the network. This enhances the personal 
nature of the machines, resulting in consistent behavior regardless of how many other 
machines there are on the network or what anyone else is doing. Large 
programs can be written, using the disk for swapping.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Network
</p><p>
The Ethernet lets both Stars and Altos have a distributed architecture. Each 
machine is connected to an Ethernet. Other machines on the Ethernet are dedicated 
as servers, machines that are attached to a resource and that provide access 
to that resource. Typical servers are these:
</p><p>
<ol>
<li><i>File server</i> &ndash; Sends and receives files over the network, storing 
them on its disks. A file server improves on a work station&rsquo;s rigid disk 
in several ways: (a) Its capacity is greater &ndash; up to 1.2 billion bytes, (b) 
It provides backup facilities, (c) It allows files to be shared among users. 
Files on a work station&rsquo;s disk are inaccessible to anyone else on the network.
<li><i>Mail server</i> &ndash; Accepts files over the network and distributes them to 
other machines on behalf of users, employing the Clearinghouse&rsquo;s database 
of names and addresses (see below).
<li><i>Print server</i> &ndash; Accepts print-format files over the network and prints 
them on the printer connected to it.
<li><i>Communication server</i> &ndash; Provides several services: The Clearinghouse 
service resolves symbolic names into network addresses.<sup><small>10</small></sup> 
The <i>Internetwork Routing service</i> manages the routing of information 
between networks over phone lines. The <i>Gateway service</i> allows word 
processors and dumb terminals to access network resources.
</ol>
</p><p>
A network-based server architecture is economical, since many machines can 
share the resources. And it frees work stations for other tasks, since 
most server actions happen in the background. For example, while a print 
server is printing your document, you can edit another document or read your mail.
</p><p class=caption>
Physical office metaphor
</p><p>
We will briefly describe one of the most important principles that influenced the 
form of the Star user interface. The reader is referred to <a href='articles/designingthestaruserinterface'>Smith et 
al.</a><sup><small>1</small></sup> for a detailed discussion of all the principles 
behind the Star design. The principle is to apply users&rsquo; existing knowledge 
to the new situation of the computer. We decided to create electronic 
counterparts to the objects in an office: paper, folders, file cabinets, 
mail boxes, calculators, and so on &ndash; an electronic metaphor for the physical 
office. We hoped that this would make the electronic world seem more 
familiar and require less training. (Our initial experiences with users have 
confirmed this.) We further decided to make the electronic analogues be <i>concrete 
objects.</i>
</p><p>
Star documents are represented, not as file names on a disk, but as pictures 
on the display screen. They may be selected by pointing to them with the 
mouse and clicking one of the mouse buttons. Once selected, documents may 
be moved, copied, or deleted by pushing the MOVE, COPY, or DELETE key on the 
keyboard. Moving a document is the electronic equivalent of picking up a piece 
of paper and walking somewhere with it. To file a document, you move it to 
a picture of a file drawer, just as you take a piece of paper to a physical 
filing cabinet. To print a document, you move it to a picture of a printer, 
just as you take a piece of paper to a copying machine.
</p><p>
Though we want an analogy with the physical world for familiarity, we don&rsquo;t 
want to limit ourselves to its capabilities. One of the <i>raisons 
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> for Star is that physical objects do not provide 
people with enough power to manage the increasing complexity of their 
information. For example, we can take advantage of the computer&rsquo;s 
ability to search rapidly by providing a search function for its electronic 
file drawers, thus helping to solve the problem of lost files.

A &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo; as it appears on the Star screen. This one has several commonly used icons along the top, including documents to serve as &ldquo;form pad&rdquo; sources for letters, memos and blank paper. There is also an open window displaying a document</td></tr></table>
Every user&rsquo;s initial view of Star is the Desktop, which resembles the 
top of an office desk, together with surrounding furniture and equipment. 
It represents a working environment, where current projects and accessible 
resources reside. On the screen (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig3'>Figure 3</a>) are displayed pictures 
of familiar office objects, such as documents, folders, file drawers, 
in-baskets, and out-baskets. These objects are displayed as small pictures, 
or <i>icons.</i>
</p><p>
You can &ldquo;open&rdquo; an icon by selecting it and pushing the OPEN key 
on the keyboard. When opened, an icon expands into a larger form called 
a <i>window,</i> which displays the icon&rsquo;s contents. This enables you 
to read documents, inspect the contents of folders and file drawers, see what 
mail has arrived, and perform other activities. Windows are the principal 
mechanism for displaying and manipulating information.
</p><p>
The Desktop surface is displayed as a distinctive grey pattern. This is 
restful and makes the icons and windows on it stand out crisply, minimizing eye 
strain. The surface is organized as an array of 1-inch squares, 14 wide 
by 11 high. An icon may be placed in any square, giving a maximum of 154 
icons. Star centers an icon in its square, making it easy to line up 
icons neatly. The Desktop always occupies the entire display screen; even when 
windows appear on the screen, the Desktop continues to exist &ldquo;beneath&rdquo; them.
</p><p>
The Desktop is the principal Star technique for realizing the physical office 
metaphor. The icons on it are visible, concrete embodiments of the 
corresponding physical objects. Star users are encouraged to think of the 
objects on the Desktop in physical terms. You can move the icons around 
to arrange your Desktop as you wish. (Messy Desktops are certainly possible, just 
as in real life.) You can leave documents on your Desktop indefinitely, just 
as on a real desk, or you can file them away.
</p><p class=caption>
Icons
</p><p>
An <i>icon</i> is a pictorial representation of a Star object that can exist on 
the Desktop. On the Desktop, the size of an icon is approximately 1 inch 
square. Inside a window such as a folder window, the size of an icon is 
approximately &frac14;-inch square. Iconic images have played a role in human 
communication from cave paintings in prehistoric times to Egyptian hieroglyphics to 
religious symbols to modern corporate logos. Computer science has been slow 
to exploit the potential of visual imagery for presenting information, 
particularly abstract information. &ldquo;Among [the] reasons are the lack 
of development of appropriate hardware and software for producing visual imagery 
easily and inexpensively; computer technology has been dominated by persons who 
seem to be happy with a simple, very limited alphabet of characters used 
to produce linear strings of symbols.&rdquo;<sup><small>11</small></sup> 
One of the authors has applied icons to an environment for writing programs; 
he found that they greatly facilitated human-computer 
communication.<sup><small>12</small></sup> Negroponte&rsquo;s Spatial Data 
Management system has effectively used iconic images in a research 
setting.<sup><small>13</small></sup> And there have been other 
efforts.<sup><small>14,15,16</small></sup> But Star is the first computer system 
designed for a mass market to employ icons methodically in its user 
interface. We do not claim that Star exploits visual communication to the 
ultimate extent; we do claim that Star&rsquo;s use of imagery is a significant 
improvement over traditional human-machine interfaces.
</p><p>
At the highest level the Star world is divided into two classes of icons, (1) 
data and (2) function icons:
</p><p class=subcaption>
Data Icons
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig4'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 4.

The &ldquo;data&rdquo; icons: document, folder and record file</td></tr></table>
Data icons (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig4'>Figure 4</a>) represent objects on which actions are performed. 
All data icons can be moved, copied, deleted, filed, mailed, printed, 
opened, closed, and have a variety of other operations performed on them. The 
three types of data icons are document, folder, and record file.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
Document
</p><p>
A document is the fundamental object in Star. It corresponds to the standard 
notion of what a document should be. It most often contains text, but it may 
also include illustrations, mathematical formulas, tables, fields, footnotes, 
and formatting information. Like all data icons, documents can be shown on 
the screen, rendered on paper, sent to other people, stored on a file server 
or floppy disk, etc. When opened, documents are always rendered on the display 
screen exactly as they print on paper (informally called &ldquo;what you see 
is what you get&rdquo;), including displaying the correct type fonts, multiple 
columns, headings and footings, illustration placement, etc. Documents can 
reside in the system in a variety of formats (e.g., Xerox 860, IBM OS6), but they 
can be edited only in Star format. Conversion operations are provided to 
translate between the various formats.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
Folder
</p><p>
A folder is used to group data icons together. It can contain documents, 
record files, and other folders. Folders can be nested inside folders to any 
level. Like file drawers (see below), folders can be sorted and searched.
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
Record file
</p><p>
A record file is a collection of information organized as a set of records. 
Frequently this information will be the variable data from forms. These records 
may be sorted, subset via pattern matching, and formatted into reports. 
Record files provide a rich set of information storage and retrieval functions.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Function Icons
</p><p>
Function icons represent objects that perform actions. Most function icons will 
operate on any data icon. There are many kinds of function icons, with 
more being added as the system evolves:
</p><p class=subsubcaption>
File drawer
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig5'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 5.

A file drawer icon</td></tr></table>
A file drawer (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig5'>Figure 5</a>) is a place to store data icons. It is modeled 
after the drawers in office filing cabinets. The organization of a file drawer is 
up to you; it can vary from a simple list of documents to 
a multilevel hierarchy of folders containing other folders. File drawers are 
distinguished from other storage places (folders, floppy disks, and the Desktop) 
in that (1) icons placed in a file drawer are physically stored on a 
file server, and (2) the contents of file drawers can be shared by multiple 
users. File drawers have associated access rights to control the ability of people to 
look at and modify their contents (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig6'>Figure 6</a>).

Although the design of file drawers was motivated by their physical 
counterparts, they are a good example of why it is neither necessary nor 
desirable to stop with just duplicating real-world behavior. People have 
a lot of trouble finding things in filing cabinets. Their categorization schemes 
are frequently ad hoc and idiosyncratic. If the person who did the categorizing 
leaves the company, information may be permanently lost. Star improves on 
physical filing cabinets by taking advantage of the computer&rsquo;s ability 
to <i>search rapidly.</i> You can search the contents of a file drawer for 
an object having a certain name, or author, or creation date, or size, 
or a variety of other attributes. The search criteria can use fuzzy patterns 
containing match-anything symbols, ranges, and other predicates. You can 
also sort the contents on the basis of those criteria. The point is 
that whatever information retrieval facilities are available in a system should 
be applied to the information in files. Any system that does not do so is 
not exploiting the full potential of the computer.

These provide the principal mechanism for sending data icons to other people 
(<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig7'>Figure 7</a>). A data icon placed in the Out basket will be sent over 
the Ethernet to a mail server (usually the same machine as a file server), thence 
to the mail servers of the recipients (which may be the same as the 
sender&rsquo;s), and thence to the In baskets of the recipients. When you 
have mail waiting for you, an envelope appears in your In basket icon. When 
you open your In basket, you can display and read the mail in the window.

Any document, record file, or folder can be mailed. Documents need not be

Printer icons (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig8'>Figure 8</a>) provide access to printing services. The 
actual printer may be directly connected to your work station, or it may 
be attached to a print server connected to an Ethernet. You can have more 
than one printer icon on your Desktop, providing access to a variety 
of printing resources. Most printers are expected to be laser-driven 
raster-scan xerographic machines; these can render on paper anything that 
can be created on the screen. Low-cost typewriter-based printers are 
also available; these can render only text.
</p><p>
As with filing and mailing, the existence of the Ethernet greatly 
enhances the power of printing. The printer represented by an icon on 
your Desktop can be in the same room as your work station, in a 
different room, in a different building, in a different city, even in 
a different country. You perform exactly the same actions to print on 
any of them: Select a data icon, push the MOVE key, and indicate the 
printer icon as the destination.

The floppy disk drive icon (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig9'>Figure 9</a>) allows you to move data icons to 
and from a floppy disk inserted in the machine. This provides a way 
to store documents, record files and folders off line. When you open 
the floppy disk drive icon, Star reads the floppy disk and displays its 
contents in the window. Its window looks and acts just like a folder 
window: icons may be moved or copied in or out, or deleted. The only 
difference is the physical location of the data.

A user icon</td></tr></table>
The user icon (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig10'>Figure 10</a>) displays the information that the system knows 
about each user: name, location, password (invisible, of course), aliases 
if any, home file and mail servers, access level (ordinary user, system 
administrator, help/training writer), and so on. We expect the information 
stored for each user to increase as Star adds new functionality. User icons may 
be placed in address fields for electronic mail.
</p><p>
User icons are Star&rsquo;s solution to the naming problem. There is a crisis 
in computer naming of people, particularly in electronic mail addressing. The 
convention in most systems is to use last names for user identification. Anyone 
named Smith, as is one of the authors, knows that this doesn&rsquo;t work. When 
he first became a user on such a system, <i>Smith</i> had long ago been taken. 
In fact, &ldquo;D. Smith&rdquo; and even &ldquo;D. C. Smith&rdquo; had been 
taken. He finally settled on &ldquo;DaveSmith&rdquo;, all one word, with 
which he has been stuck to this day. Needless to say, that is <i>not</i> how he 
identifies himself to people. In the future, people will not tolerate this 
kind of antihumanism from computers. Star already does better: it follows 
society&rsquo;s conventions. User icons provide unambiguous unique references to 
individual people, using their normal names. The information about users, 
and indeed about all network resources, is physically stored in the 
Clearinghouse, a distributed database of names. In addition to a person&rsquo;s 
name in the ordinary sense, this information includes the name of the 
organization (e.g., Xerox, General Motors) and the name of the user&rsquo;s 
division within the organization. A person&rsquo;s linear name need be 
unique only within his division. It can be fully spelled out if necessary, 
including spaces and punctuation. Aliases can be defined. User icons are 
<i>references</i> to this information. You need not even know, let alone type, 
the unique linear representation for a user; you need only have the icon.

User group icons (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig11'>Figure 11</a>) contain individual users and/or other user 
groups. They allow you to organize people according to various criteria. User 
groups serve both to control access to information such as file drawers (access 
control lists) and to make it easy to send mail to a large number of 
people (distribution lists). The latter is becoming increasingly important as more 
and more people start to take advantage of computer-assisted communication. 
At Xerox we have found that as soon as there were more than a thousand 
Alto users, there were almost always enough people interested in any topic 
whatsoever to form a distribution list for it. These user groups have 
broken the bonds of geographical proximity that have historically limited 
group membership and communication. They have begun to turn Xerox into 
a nationwide &ldquo;village,&rdquo; just as the Arpanet has brought computer 
science researchers around the world closer together. This may be the 
most profound impact that computers have on society.

of the terminal icons and type into its window; the contents of the 
window behave exactly as if you were typing at the corresponding terminal. 
Text in the window can be copied to and from Star documents, which makes 
Star&rsquo;s rich environment available to them.

The Directory provides access to network resources. It serves as the source 
for icons representing those resources; the Directory contains one icon 
for each resource available (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig14'>Figure 14</a>). When you are first registered in 
a Star network, your Desktop contains nothing but a Directory icon. From 
this initial state, you access resources such as file drawers, printers, 
and mail baskets by opening the Directory and copying out their icons. You 
can also get blank data icons out of the Directory. You can retrieve other 
data icons from file drawers. Star places no limits on the complexity 
of your Desktop except the limitation imposed by physical screen area 
(<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig15'>Figure 15</a>). The Directory also contains Remote Directories representing 
resources available on other networks. These can be opened, recursively, 
and their resource icons copied out, just as with the local Directory. You 
deal with local and remote resources in exactly the same way.

The important thing to observe is that although the functions performed by 
the various icons differ, the way you interact with them is the same. You 
select them with the mouse. You push the MOVE, COPY, or DELETE key. You push 
the OPEN key to see their contents, the PROPERTIES key to see their properties, 
and the SAME key to copy their properties. This is the result of rigorously 
applying the principle of uniformity to the design of icons. We have 
applied it to other areas of Star as well, as will be seen.
</p><p class=caption>
Windows
</p><p>
Windows are rectangular areas that display the contents of icons on the 
screen. Much of the inspiration for Star&rsquo;s design
came from Alan Kay&rsquo;s Flex machine<sup><small>17</small></sup> and his 
later Smalltalk programming environment on the Alto.<sup><small>18</small></sup> 
The Officetalk treatment of windows was also influential; in fact, 
Officetalk, an experimental office-forms-processing system on the Alto, provided 
ideas in a variety of areas.<sup><small>19</small></sup> Windows greatly 
increase the amount of information that can be manipulated on a display 
screen. Up to six windows at a time can be open in Star. Each window has 
a header containing the name of the icon and a menu of commands. The 
commands consist of a standard set present in all windows (&ldquo;?&rdquo;, CLOSE, 
SET WINDOW) and others that depend on the type of icon. For example, the 
window for a record file contains commands tailored to information retrieval. 
CLOSE removes the window from the display screen, returning the icon to 
its tiny size. The &ldquo;?&rdquo; command displays the online documentation 
describing the type of window and its applications.
</p><p>
Each window has two scroll bars for scrolling the contents vertically and 
horizontally. The scroll bars have jump-to-end areas for quickly going to 
the top, bottom, left, or right end of the contents. The vertical scroll 
bar also has areas labeled N and P for quickly getting the next or previous 
screenful of the contents; in the case of a document window, they go to 
the next or previous page. Finally, the vertical scroll bar has a jumping area 
for going to a particular part of the contents, such as to a particular page 
in a document.
</p><p>
Unlike the windows in some Alto programs, Star windows do not overlap. 
This is a deliberate decision, based on our observation that many Alto 
users were spending an inordinate amount of time manipulating windows themselves 
rather than their contents. This manipulation of the medium is overhead, 
and we want to reduce it. Star automatically partitions the display space 
among the currently open windows. You can control on which side of 
the screen a window appears and its height.
</p><p class=caption>
Property sheets
</p><p>
At a finer grain, the Star world is organized in terms of <i>objects</i>
that have <i>properties</i> and upon which <i>actions</i> are performed. A few 
examples of objects in Star are text characters, text paragraphs, graphic lines, 
graphic illustrations, mathematical summation signs, mathematical formulas, 
and icons. Every object has properties. Properties of text characters 
include type style, size, face, and posture (e.g., bold, italic). Properties 
of paragraphs include indentation, leading, and alignment. Properties of 
graphic lines include thickness and structure (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted). 
Properties of document icons include name, size, creator, and creation 
date. So the properties of an object depend on the type of the object. These 
ideas are similar to the notions of classes, objects, and messages in 
Simula<sup><small>20</small></sup> and Smalltalk. Among the editors that use 
these ideas are the experimental text editor Bravo<sup><small>21</small></sup> 
and the experimental graphics editor Draw<sup><small>22</small></sup>, both 
developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. These all supplied valuable 
knowledge and insight to Star. In fact, the text editor aspects of 
Star were derived from Bravo.

In order to make properties visible, we invented the notion of a 
property sheet (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig16'>Figure 16</a>). A property sheet is a two-dimensional 
formlike environment which shows the properties of an object. To display one, 
you select the object of interest using the mouse and push the PROPERTIES 
key on the keyboard. Property sheets may contain three types of parameters:
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig17'><img class=screenshot alt='Figure 17.

The option sheet for the Find command</td></tr></table>
<ol>
<li><i>State</i> &ndash; State parameters display an independent property, which 
may be either on or off. You turn it on or off by pointing to it with the 
mouse and clicking a mouse button. When on, the parameter is shown video 
reversed. In general, any combination of state parameters in a property sheet 
can be on. If several state parameters are logically related, they are shown 
on the same line with space between them. (See &ldquo;Face&rdquo; in <a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig16'>Figure 16</a>.)
<li><i>Choice</i> &ndash; Choice parameters display a set of mutually exclusive 
values for a property. Exactly one value must be on at all times. As with 
state parameters, you turn on a choice by pointing to it with the mouse 
and clicking a mouse button. If you turn on a different value, the system 
turns off the previous one. Again the one that is on is shown video 
reversed. (See &ldquo;Font&rdquo; in <a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig16'>Figure 16</a>.) The motivation for 
state and choice parameters is the observation that it is generally easier to 
take a multiple-choice test than a fill-in-the-blanks one. When options 
are made visible, they become easier to understand, remember, and use.
<li><i>Text</i> &ndash; Text parameters display a box into which you can type 
a value. This provides a (largely) unconstrained choice space; you may type 
any value you please, within the limits of the system. The disadvantage 
of this is that the set of possible values is not visible; therefore 
Star uses text parameters only when that set is large. (See &ldquo;Search for&rdquo; 
in <a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig17'>Figure 17</a>.)
</ol>
</p><p>
Property sheets have several important attributes:
</p><p>
<ol>
<li>A small number of parameters gives you a large number of combinations of 
properties. They permit a rich choice space without a lot of complexity. For 
example, the character property sheet alone provides for 8 fonts, from 
1 to 6 sizes for each (an average of about 2), 4 faces (any
combination of which can be on), and 8 positions relative to the baseline 
(including OTHER, which lets you type in a value). So in just four 
parameters, there are over 8&times;2&times;2<sup><small>4</small></sup>&times;8 
= 2048 combinations of character properties.
<li>They show all of the properties of an object. None is hidden. You are 
constantly reminded what is available every time you display a property sheet.
<li>They provide progressive disclosure. There are a large number of properties 
in the system as a whole, but you want to deal with only a small subset 
at any one time. Only the properties of the selected object are shown.
<li>They provide a &ldquo;bullet-proof&rdquo; environment for altering the 
characteristics of an object. Since only the properties of the selected 
object are shown, you can&rsquo;t accidentally alter other objects. Since only 
valid choices are displayed, you can&rsquo;t specify illegal properties. This 
reduces errors.
</ol>
</p><p>
Property sheets are an example of the Star design principle that <i>seeing and 
pointing</i> is preferred over <i>remembering and typing.</i> You don&rsquo;t 
have to remember what properties are available for an object; the property 
sheet will show them to you. This reduces the burden on your memory, which 
is particularly important in a functionally rich system. And most properties 
can be changed by a simple pointing action with the mouse.

The three types of parameters are also used in <i>option sheets.</i> (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig18'>Figure 
18</a>). Option sheets are just like property sheets, except that they provide a 
visual interface for <i>arguments to commands</i> instead of <i>properties of 
objects.</i> For example, in the Find option sheet there is a text parameter 
for the string to search for, a choice parameter for the range over which 
to search, and a state parameter (CHANGE IT) controlling whether to replace 
that string with another one. When CHANGE IT is turned on, an additional set 
of parameters appears to contain the replacement text. This technique of 
having some parameters appear depending on the settings of others is another 
part of our strategy of progressive disclosure: hiding information (and therefore 
complexity) until it is needed, but making it visible when it is needed. The 
various sheets appear simpler than if all the options were always shown.
</p><p class=caption>
Commands
</p><p>
Commands in Star take the form of noun-verb pairs. You specify the object of 
interest (the noun) and then invoke a command to manipulate it (the verb). 
Specifying an object is called <i>making a selection.</i> Star provides 
powerful selection mechanisms, which reduce the number and complexity of 
commands in the system. Typically, you exercise more dexterity and judgment 
in making a selection than in invoking a command. The ways to make a selection 
are as follows:
</p><p>
<ol>
<li>With the mouse &ndash; Place the cursor over the object on the screen you 
want to select and click the first (SELECT) mouse button. Additional objects can 
be selected by using the second (ADJUST) mouse button; it adjusts the 
selection to include more or fewer objects. Most selections are made in this way.
<li>With the NEXT key on the keyboard &ndash; Push the NEXT key, and the system 
will select the contents of the next field in a document. Fields are one 
of the types of special higher-level objects that can be placed in documents. 
If the selection is currently in a table, NEXT will step through the rows 
and columns of the table, making it easy to fill in and modify them. If 
the selection is currently in a mathematical formula, NEXT will step through 
the various elements in the formula, making it easy to edit them. NEXT is 
like an intelligent step key; it moves the selection between semantically 
meaningful locations in a document.
<li>With a command &ndash; Invoke the FIND command, and the system will select 
the next occurrence of the specified text, if there is one. Other commands 
that make a selection include OPEN (the first object in the opened window 
is selected) and CLOSE (the icon that was closed becomes selected). These 
optimize the use of the system.
</ol>
<p><p>
The object (noun) is almost always specified before the action (verb) to be 
performed. This makes the command interface modeless; you can change your 
mind as to which object to affect simply by changing the selection before 
invoking the command.<sup><small>23</small></sup> No &ldquo;accept&rdquo; function 
is needed to terminate or confirm commands, since invoking the command 
is the last step. Inserting text does not require a command; you simply 
make a selection and begin typing. The text is placed after the end of 
the selection. A few commands require more than one operand and hence are 
modal. For example, the MOVE and COPY commands require a destination as 
well as a source.
</p><p class=caption>
Generic commands
</p><p>
Star has a few commands that can be used throughout the system: MOVE, COPY, 
DELETE, SHOW PROPERTIES, COPY PROPERTIES, AGAIN, UNDO, and HELP. Each performs 
the same way regardless of the type of object selected. Thus we call them 
generic commands. For example, you follow the same set of actions to 
move text in a document as to move a document in a folder or a line in 
an illustration: select the object, move the MOVE key, and indicate the 
destination. Each generic command has a key devoted to it on the keyboard. 
(HELP and UNDO don&rsquo;t use a selection.)
</p><p>
These commands are more basic than the ones in other computer systems. They 
strip away extraneous application-specific semantics to get at the underlying 
principles. Star&rsquo;s generic commands are derived from <i>fundamental 
computer science concepts</i> because they also underlie operations in 
programming languages. For example, program manipulation of data structures 
involves moving or copying values from one data structure to another. 
Since Star&rsquo;s generic commands embody fundamental underlying concepts, they 
are widely applicable. Each command fills a host of needs. Few commands 
are required. This simplicity is desirable in itself, but it has another subtle 
advantage: it makes it easy for users to form a model of the system. 
What people can understand, they can use. Just as progress in science 
derives from simple, clear theories, so progress in the usability of 
computers depends on simple, clear user interfaces.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Move
</p><p>
MOVE is the most powerful command in the system. It is used during text 
editing to rearrange letters in a word, words in a sentence, sentences in 
a paragraph, and paragraphs in a document. It is used during graphics editing 
to move picture elements such as lines and rectangles around in an 
illustration. It is used during formula editing to move mathematical structures such 
as summations and integrals around in an equation. It replaces the 
conventional &ldquo;store file&rdquo; and &ldquo;retrieve file&rdquo; commands; 
you simply move an icon into or out of a file drawer or folder. 
It eliminates the &ldquo;send mail&rdquo; and &ldquo;receive mail&rdquo; commands; 
you move an icon to an Out basket or from an In basket. It replaces the &ldquo;print&rdquo; 
command; you move an icon to a printer. And so on. MOVE strips away much 
of the historical clutter of computer commands. It is more fundamental than the 
myriad of commands it replaces. It is simultaneously more powerful and simpler.
</p><p>
MOVE also reinforces Star&rsquo;s physical metaphor: a moved object can be in 
only one place at one time. Most computer file transfer programs only make 
copies; they leave the originals behind. Although this is an admirable 
attempt to keep information from accidentally getting lost, an unfortunate 
side effect is that sometimes you lose track of where the most recent 
information is, since there are multiple copies floating around. MOVE lets 
you model the way you manipulate information in the real world, should you 
wish to. We expect that during the <i>creation</i> of information, people will primarily 
use MOVE; during the <i>dissemination</i> of information, people will make 
extensive use of COPY.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Copy
</p><p>
COPY is just like MOVE, except that it leaves the original object behind 
untouched. Star elevates the concept of copying to the level of a <i>paradigm 
for creating.</i> In all the various domains of Star, you <i>create by copying.</i>
Creating something out of nothing is a difficult task. Everyone has 
observed that it is easier to modify an existing document or program 
than to write it originally. Picasso once said, &ldquo;The most awful thing 
for a painter is the white canvas... To copy others is 
necessary.&rdquo;<sup><small>24</small></sup> Star makes a serious attempt to 
alleviate the problem of the &ldquo;white canvas,&rdquo; to make copying a 
practical aid to creation. Consider:

Typically you set up blank 
documents with appropriate formatting properties (e.g., fonts, margins) and 
then use those documents as form pad sources for new documents. You select one, 
push COPY, and presto, you have a new document. The form pad documents 
need not be blank; they can contain text and graphics, along with fields 
for variable text such as for business forms.

Desktop by copying them out of the Directory. The icons are registered in 
the Directory by a system administrator working at a server. You simply copy 
them out; no other initialization is required.

Star supplies an initial set of such images, called <i>transfer symbols.</i> Transfer 
symbols are based on the idea of dry-transfer rub-off symbols used by many 
secretaries and graphic artists. Unlike the physical transfer symbols, 
however, the computer versions can be modified: they can be moved, 
their sizes and proportions can be changed, and their appearance properties can 
be altered. Thus a single Star transfer symbol can produce a wide range 
of images. We will eventually supply a set of documents (transfer sheets) 
containing nothing but special images tailored to one application or 
another: people, buildings, vehicles, machinery. Having these as sources 
for graphics copying helps to alleviate the &ldquo;white canvas&rdquo; feeling.

In a sense, you can even type characters by copying them from keyboard 
windows. Since there are many more characters (up to 2<sup><small>16</small></sup>) 
in the Star character set than there are keys on the keyboard, Star 
provides a series of keyboard interpretation windows (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig19'>Figure 19</a>), which 
allow you to see and change the meanings of the keyboard keys. You are 
presented with the options; you look them over and choose the ones you want.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Delete
</p><p>
This deletes the selected object. If you delete something by mistake, UNDO 
will restore it.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Show Properties
</p><p>
SHOW PROPERTIES displays the properties of the selected object in a property 
sheet. You select the object(s) of interest, push the PROPERTIES (PROP&rsquo;S) 
key, and the appropriate property sheet appears on the screen in such 
a position as to not overlie the selection, if possible. You may change 
as many properties as you wish, including none. When finished, you invoke the 
Done command in the property sheet menu. The property changes are applied 
to the selected objects, and the property sheet disappears. Notice that SHOW 
PROPERTIES is therefore used both to examine the current properties of an 
object and to change those properties.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Copy Properties
</p><p>
You need not use property sheets to alter properties if there is 
another object on the screen that already has the desired properties. You 
can select the object(s) to be changed, push the SAME key, then designate the 
object to use as the source. COPY PROPERTIES makes the selection look 
the &ldquo;same&rdquo; as the source. This is particularly useful 
in graphics editing. Frequently you will have a collection of lines 
and symbols whose appearance you want to be coordinated (all the same line width, 
shade of grey, etc.). You can select all the objects to be changed, 
push SAME, and select a line or symbol having the desired appearance. In 
fact, we find it helpful to set up a document with a variety of graphic 
objects in a variety of appearances to be used as sources for copying properties.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Again
</p><p>
AGAIN repeats the last command(s) on a new selection. All the commands done 
since the last time a selection was made are repeated. This is useful 
when a short sequence of commands needs to be done on several different 
selections; for example, make several scattered words bold and italic 
and in a larger font.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Undo
</p><p>

UNDO reverses the effects of the last command. It provides protection against 
mistakes, making the system more forgiving and user-friendly. Only a 
few commands cannot be repeated or undone.
</p><p class=subcaption>
Help
</p><p>
Our effort to make Star a personal, self-contained system goes beyond the 
hardware and software to the tools that Star provides to teach people how 
to use the system. Nearly all of its teaching and reference material 
is on line, stored on a file server. The Help facilities automatically retrieve the 
relevant material as you request it.
</p><p>
The HELP key on the keyboard is the primary entrance into this online 
information. You can push it at any time, and a window will appear on 
the screen displaying the Help table of contents (<a href='articles/thestaruserinterfaceanoverview/pics/fig20'>Figure 20</a>). Three 
mechanisms make finding information easier: <i>context-dependent invocation, help 
references,</i> and a <i>keyword search command.</i> Together they make the 
online documentation more powerful and useful than printed documentation.

Summary
</p><p>
We have learned from Star the importance of formulating the user&rsquo;s 
conceptual model first, before software is written, rather than tacking on 
a user interface afterward. Doing good user interface design is not easy. 
Xerox devoted about thirty work-years to the design of the Star user 
interface. It was designed before the functionality of the system was 
fully decided. It was designed before the computer hardware was even 
built. We worked for two years before we wrote a single line of actual 
product software. Jonathan Seybold put it this way: &ldquo;Most system design 
efforts start with hardware specifications, follow this with a set of 
functional specifications for the software, then try to figure out 
a logical user interface and command structure. The Star project started 
the other way around: the paramount concern was to define a conceptual model 
of how the user would relate to the system. Hardware and software followed 
from this.&rdquo;<sup><small>4</small></sup>
</p><p>
Alto served as a valuable prototype for Star. Over a thousand Altos 
were eventually built, and Alto users have had several thousand work-years of 
experience with them over a period of eight years, making Alto 
perhaps the largest prototyping effort in history. There were dozens of 
experimental programs written for the Alto by members of the Xerox Palo Alto 
Research Center. Without the creative ideas of the authors of those 
systems, Star in its present form would have been impossible. On the 
other hand, it was a real challenge to bring some order to the different 
user interfaces on the Alto. In addition, we ourselves programmed various 
aspects of the Star design on Alto, but every bit (sic) of it was throwaway 
code. Alto, with its bit-mapped display screen, was powerful enough to implement and 
test our ideas on visual interaction.
