Reporting on the technical specifications of a computer toward the end of 
an article is unusual for BYTE, but it emphasizes that the <i>why</i> of Lisa is more 
important than the <i>what</i>. For part of the market, at least, the Lisa 
computer will change the emphasis of microcomputing from &ldquo;How much RAM 
does it have?&rdquo; to &ldquo;What can it do for me?&rdquo; For example, it 
is almost misleading to say that the Lisa comes with one megabyte of RAM, 
even though the fact itself is true. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Lisa is 
sixteen times better than machines that have 64K bytes of RAM. Nor does 
it necessarily mean that the Lisa can work on much larger data files than other 
computers; its application programs each take 200K to 300K bytes, which 
significantly reduces the memory available for data. It&rsquo;s more instructive 
to say, for example, that the Lisa with one megabyte can hold a 100-row by 
50-column spreadsheet (as its advertisements state). With this in mind, let&rsquo;s 
take a look at the Lisa.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Lisa&rdquo; stands for Local Integrated Software Architecture, but it&rsquo;s 
really just an excuse to retain Apple&rsquo;s pet name for the project. The Lisa 
has a 68000 microprocessor, which is a true 16-bit microcomputer that has a 16-bit 
data bus, a 24-bit address bus (giving access to 16 megabytes of memory), and 32-bit-wide
registers (all but the 16-bit status register). The 68000 in the Lisa runs 
at a frequency of 5 MHz. It can have up to 1 megabyte of memory with parity and 
comes standard with one megabyte (1024K bytes).
</p><p>
The video display is a 12-inch monochrome monitor (black and white, not tinted) 
with a resolution of 720 by 364 pixels. The interlaced image is refreshed at 
60 Hz, which eliminates the possibility of eyestrain from subliminal flickering. 
The video display is completely generated by internal software, so the Lisa can 
use multiple character sizes and fonts without restriction. It also means that Apple 
is not restricted to any one style of video image; the designers can radically 
change the behavior of the system with a new release of software.
</p><p>
The Apple 871 disk drives design (called &ldquo;twiggy drives&rdquo; inside the 
company) are significantly different from conventional floppy-disk drives. Each 
one uses a 6504 microprocessor as a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; interface between it 
and the Lisa. The drives use special high-density, double-sided floppy disks that 
have two oval cutouts in the jacket (see photo below). These are essential 
because the two disk heads, in addition to being on opposite sides of the 
flat magnetic media, are not pointed at each other with the magnetic media 
between them, as is the case in all other double-sided floppy-disk drives. 
Instead, a pad presses the rotating magnetic media to the disk head on the 
opposite side of the media as is conventionally done with single-headed floppy disks.
</p><p>

Each formatted disk holds 860K bytes of information at a density of 62.5 
tracks per inch; together the two drives (standard on the Lisa) hold 1.72 
megabytes of data. Each drive also contains a mechanism that releases the 
disk for removal under program control, which prevents the user from removing 
a floppy disk prematurely. As with other Apple products, the floppy disks rotate 
only when the drives are reading or writing data, thus extending the lives of 
both the drives and the medium.
</p><p>
Apple has done several things to achieve its unusually high data density. The 
designers used an encoding scheme that keeps a constant data density of 10,000 
bits per linear inch: this allows the outer floppy-disk tracks, which have 
a larger circumference, to store more data than the tracks nearest the
center of the disk. In addition, the disk-access system software can move the 
disk heads in fractions of a track width to search for and find the middle 
of the track. That&rsquo;s an important feature when you&rsquo;re reading disks 
with small variations in track width.
</p><p>
In addition, the Lisa comes with one Profile (Apple&rsquo;s 5&frac14;-inch 
Winchester-type hard disk) to the Lisa through its parallel port. It adds 
5 megabytes of magnetic storage to the
Lisa system, and speeds up the overall operation of the system. Additional 
Profiles can be added via interface cards.
</p><p>
The Lisa computer is never really turned off. It stores &ldquo;system preferences&rdquo; 
(things like speaker volume and video contrast) and system-configuration information 
inside the computer. Even when it is turned &ldquo;off,&rdquo; it draws 
enough power to keep the clock/calendar and CMOS memory containing the 
above information working. When it&rsquo;s unplugged (for example, when it&rsquo;s 
being moved to another location), internal batteries preserve the clock/calendar 
status and CMOS memory for up to 20 hours.

The Lisa includes two programmable serial ports and one parallel port as 
well as three expansion-board slots, each of which connects directly to the 
system bus and has direct memory access (DMA) capabilities. Because none of 
these slots is filled in any &ldquo;basic&rdquo; configuration of the Lisa, 
they are available for future expansion (unlike the IBM Personal Computer&rsquo;s 
five slots, most or all of which are used for much-needed video-display and 
memory cards). Other features include a built-in speaker and a real-time 
clock (which can be programmed to execute tasks or turn the computer 
itself on or off at a given time), a microprocessor-controlled detachable 
Selectric-style keyboard, and a mouse.
</p><p>
I must thank Apple for including something I&rsquo;ve wanted to see for a 
long time: unique serial numbers encoded into memory. The Lisa has 
two of these: an actual serial number
and a 48-bit number meant to be used as a &ldquo;mail address&rdquo; identification 
number for a network of Lisa computers. Two unique identification numbers 
will help to prevent the unfortunate but very real problems of software piracy 
and the existence of copy-protected disks that won&rsquo;t work for even their 
legal user. Software can be &ldquo;mated&rdquo; to the serial number of 
a given machine so that it can be backed up endlessly but will not run 
on another Lisa computer. True, a persistent few will outwit even this scheme, 
but it will practically eliminate a manufacturer&rsquo;s sales losses from copied software.

An interesting aspect of the Lisa is that it abandons hardware graphics 
chips like the NEC 7220 for system software that requires the 68000 microprocessor 
to generate and maintain the video image. At first, I questioned the 
wisdom of this decision because it makes the 68000 assume a heavy computational 
burden that could be transferred from software to hardware. But according to 
the designers, the use of a dedicated hardware graphics chip would 
itself limit and slow down the system (for a discussion of this, see the 
interview on page 90). In particular, the 68000 clock was set at 5 MHz instead of 
the usual 8 MHz to give the hardware just enough time to access the 32K 
bytes of screen memory during the machine cycles in which the 68000 is 
not using the address lines. This gives the Lisa access to the video memory 
that is transparent to the 68000 (hardware
graphics chips severely limit access to the video memory) and results in a static-free 
image. (Much of the static or &ldquo;hashing&rdquo; in graphic video images results 
from the system accessing the video memory while the circuitry is using it 
to generate the video image.)

Apple will also be offering the Apple Dot Matrix Printer
and the Apple Letter Quality Printer. Apple&rsquo;s engineers tested many existing 
printers, chose two (from C. Itoh and Qume, respectively) that best met 
their needs, then had the companies produce modified versions with Apple-specified 
hardware and software changes. Apple needed such exacting print quality because 
the Lisa software is very demanding of both printers. For example, both 
printers will reproduce almost exactly both the text and graphics that can be 
displayed on the Lisa screen. In addition, Apple has created special print 
wheels for its Letter Quality Printer so that you can print normal, italic, 
underlined, and bold characters without changing print wheels (quite a 
nice move &ndash; who&rsquo;s going to change print wheels several times a page just 
to get true italics?). The amazing thing about the Apple Dot Matrix Printer 
is that Apple plans to sell it for around $700 (the Letter Quality Printer 
will sell for about $2100). Unfortunately for Apple II and III owners, these 
printers&rsquo; tricks are done entirely in software on the Lisa and won&rsquo;t 
transfer to other Apple computers.
