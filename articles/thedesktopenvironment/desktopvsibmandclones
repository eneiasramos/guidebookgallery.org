With the release of software packages such as Symphony (Lotus Development 
Corp.), Framework (Ashton-Tate), VisiOn (VisiCorp), Quarterdeck DesQ and many 
others, the desktop metaphor has come to the IBM Personal Computer and 
IBM-compatibles. Or has it? One of the hottest debates in the industry now 
is just how &ldquo;transportable&rdquo; the desktop environment really is.
</p><p>
The answer would seem to depend a great deal on how you define the desktop. 
Windowing, as demonstrated by the products named above, is certainly possible on 
a 16-bit MS-DOS based computer such as the IBM Personal Computer. But 
other elements of the desktop metaphor as seen on the Xerox Star and Apple 
Lisa &ndash; including the use of a mouse controller to select pull-down menus 
and screen icons representing files and programs &ndash; are absent in the 
major windowing packages appearing for the IBM, due to what the developers 
of those packages perceive as limitations in the IBM&rsquo;s system.
</p><p>
&ldquo;The generic desktop environment will evolve into all sorts of 
actual products,&rdquo; argues Mitch Kapor, president of Lotus Development. &ldquo;As 
for the mouse and icons, I really think that is a function of the best fit 
to technology. We were not convinced that on the IBM Personal Computer and its brethren
there was sufficient resolution or quality of display devices or, in fact, 
necessarily enough memory to fully embed icon and mouse support. The Lotus 
Macintosh product (which will not be available until a 512k version of the 
Macintosh is released at the end of 1984) fully supports the mouse and 
icons. So why we or anybody else might or might not choose to use certain parts 
of the desktop environment as originally seen on the Star is really a function 
of what&rsquo;s going to work on a given piece of hardware.
</p><p>
&ldquo;I think there are software absolutists... people who believe in windows 
and mice apparently for their own sake,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Philosophically, 
they say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve seen this and we&rsquo;re going this way. This is 
what we build our products around.&rsquo; We, I think, have a more flexible, 
less purely ideological approach to building products. It&rsquo;s not so much 
a question of adapting the Lisa/Star metaphor but of using that as one of 
a number of important building blocks in creating a product.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Forefront Corp.&rsquo;s Robert Carr seems to agree with Kapor, saying, &ldquo;As 
a designer I would love to be told, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a very high-resolution 
screen, you&rsquo;ve got a Motorola 68000 microprocessor or even more powerful 
chip, you&rsquo;ve got 512k of memory, go do it.&rsquo; I think the graphic 
representation above all else is
what you can do better with that kind of hardware. To be frank, I think that would 
be a better system than one that limits itself to working on a character (rather 
than graphics-based) screen. Unfortunately, the price-functionality curve 
on the hardware is not yet at a point where you&rsquo;re going to be able 
to deliver the benefits of the desktop metaphor to that many people that way 
compared to aiming for a lower hardware base requirement. We&rsquo;ve tried to 
draw the line where we can bring as much of the desktop technology as possible to 
as many people as possible, by shooting for a hardware base that is very minimal.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Chris Morgan, vice president of communications for Lotus Development, agrees. &ldquo;The 
metaphor has to make sense with the given hardware,&rdquo; he says, adding that 
features such as screen icons are more suited to machines such as the 
Macintosh with its higher graphics resolution. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re working 
within the confines of the average color monitor there are trade-offs. There 
are only so many pixels on that screen that you can use to create an image. So 
what you want is simplicity on such a display.
</p><p>
One of those trade-offs &ndash; the lack of screen icons &ndash; is a major one, 
according to Jeff Elpren (former president of Simtec, a large computer sales 
organization). &ldquo;The retrofit of windows on the IBM doesn&rsquo;t really address its
symbolizing &ndash; the use of icons as a high-level symbolic language,&rdquo; Elpren 
says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still communicating at a much lower level. If you 
put them side by side and give yourself a task of copying all the files on 
one disk to another, you&rsquo;ll quickly see how much more rapidly you communicate 
using the icons. So it addresses one need and is superior to a non-windowing 
environment, but it doesn&rsquo;t go all the way.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Apple&rsquo;s Bill Atkinson questions whether software developers should go that 
way at all. &ldquo;You have to have enough horsepower to back this up or it&rsquo;s 
not the right thing to do,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all seen the 
windowing on Lisa and Mac and the Star and said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see, this 
looks like the wave of the future, let&rsquo;s do it&rsquo; and sort of all 
jumped on the bandwagon without counting the cost and making sure they&rsquo;ve 
got enough processing power to do it. The Motorola 68000 (the microprocessor in 
the Lisa and Macintosh) is just barely keeping up. The poor little IBM doesn&rsquo;t 
have a chance.
</p><p>
&ldquo;I think that people are interested in it and doing it is a validation of 
the concept,&rdquo; Atkinson adds. &ldquo;But the problem is they don&rsquo;t have 
enough horsepower to do a good implementation of it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Robert Carr, who worked in Xerox&rsquo;s Advanced Systems Department on a planned 
successor to the Star prior to forming Forefront Corp. and developing Framework for 
Ashton-Tate, offers a different opinion. &ldquo;I think when you&rsquo;re examining 
the validity you have to look at the real needs of real users in the marketplace,&rdquo; 
he says. &ldquo;I doubt that very many people would disagree that hi-res screens 
and having a tremendous amount of computing power enhance the desktop metaphor and 
allow you to do more things. The Star and Lisa systems have been exploring that 
direction. But I think you have to look at the realities of the marketplace 
out there and ask the question: &lsquo;Is this pie-in-the-sky technology that can 
only be used by the few tens of thousands of people out there that can afford these 
machines or is it something that you can bring to the hundreds of thousands 
of people out there who are buying IBMs?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p><p>
When we repeated Carr&rsquo;s appraisal of &ldquo;the realities of the marketplace&rdquo; 
to John Shoch, president of the office systems division of Xerox, his reaction 
was: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s clearly a fallacy. If that were the case IBM would 
have brought out a CP/M machine with an 8-bit processor or a clone of the Apple. 
My view of that is that there comes a time when you cannot ask a Volkswagen to 
pull a horse trailer.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In Shoch&rsquo;s view, the desktop metaphor as presented on the Star remains &ldquo;the 
goal towards which many other developers are striving. They have been able to pick up 
only pieces of Star or a thin veneer of its capabilities. What they&rsquo;ve tried 
to do is squeeze as much of the Star&rsquo;s capabilities as they can into a smaller 
machine. We looked at that option ourselves and we chose not to do it. We thought 
it would be an unsatisfactory presentation.&rdquo; He adds that he welcomes Xerox&rsquo;s 
new competition in the area of desktop environment software and hardware, feeling 
that &ldquo;people will get a taste of it in systems like VisiOn, Framework 
and Symphony,&rdquo; but that as their &ldquo;expectations continue to spiral 
upward, people will come to appreciate the depth and capability of Star.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In the end, talk alone won&rsquo;t decide whether the IBM Personal Computer can offer 
the desktop environment or even a facsimile of what is presented on the Lisa and 
Star. That answer will only come as users begin to explore these new products and 
see for themselves whether the promised benefits are really all that their vested 
interests represent them to be. Tacked onto a recent across-the-board price cut 
announcement was IBM&rsquo;s acknowledgement that larger minimum memory requirements 
of &ldquo;new, powerful programs that offer windowing functions&rdquo; was behind 
recent product design changes in its personal computer line. What seemed to be 
almost an aside, in this case, might have been the first hint that IBM has another 
new, soon-to-be-revealed, definition of desktop environment.
</p><p>
And when IBM takes time to define something, they rarely have a limited market in mind.
