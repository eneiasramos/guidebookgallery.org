<p>
Every computer system, from the largest mainframe computer to the smallest portable, 
has a control program that enables you to operate the printer, load other programs, 
look at the names of files stored on disk, and perform myriad other useful tasks. 
This program, called the &ldquo;operating system,&rdquo; is the hub around which 
all other software revolves. Some operating systems have become so well known that 
their names are part of the standard jargon of computer users and programmers &ndash; 
names such as UNIX (developed at Bell Laboratories), VM (for large IBM machines), 
CP/M (used with many home computers), and MS-DOS (for the IBM PC and compatibles).
</p><p>
On most systems, the manner in which you use the operating system commands and, 
in fact, even the structure of the commands themselves, differs significantly from the 
way you use the various application programs (the word processing package, the 
spreadsheet tool, and data base management system, for example). The reasons 
for this lamentable situation are partly historical (it&rsquo;s always been that way) 
and partly cultural (the programmers who traditionally design operating systems 
have not been the same programmers who design application software). Regardless 
of the reason, you, the user, bear the brunt of this inconsistency. Consequently, using 
operating systems often is one of the more frustrating tasks the typical computer user 
must tackle. Or it was, until Lisa.
</p><p>
Lisa&rsquo;s operating system, the <i>Desktop Manager,</i> is a program that closely 
resembles the other Lisa programs in ease of use and user interface. In 
fact, many Lisa users who have never before used a computer aren&rsquo;t even aware 
that they&rsquo;re using an operating system because it is so transparent and 
so much like the rest of Lisa&rsquo;s operation.
</p><p>
Lisa&rsquo;s <i>Desktop Manager</i> performs many functions that you don&rsquo;t 
really think about &ndash; or even have to know about. Consider, for example, 
the job of finding a particular <i>LisaWrite</i> document on Lisa&rsquo;s internal 
hard disk. That disk holds about 10 million characters. Even assuming that 
you&rsquo;re looking for a 200-page document, it would take up less than 1 percent 
of the disk&rsquo;s capacity. Why isn&rsquo;t lost in all that space?
</p><p>
When you open a <i>LisaCalc</i> spreadsheet, the <i>LisaCalc</i> menu titles &ndash; 
not the <i>LisaProject</i> or <i>LisaGraph</i> titles &ndash; automatically appear 
in the menu title bar. What keeps the right ones in place? How does Lisa know 
how to store information on a micro diskette? Surely it must be different from 
writing on the hard disk or on the Profile?
</p><p>
The <i>Desktop Manager</i> performs all of these tasks. You needn&rsquo;t worry 
about any of them.
</p><p>
In addition to these invisible tasks, the <i>Desktop Manager</i> performs many 
actions you need to know about in order to operate Lisa smoothly, to back 
up your files, and to use the utilities provided by the <i>Desktop Manager.</i>
</p><p class=caption>
Conventions and components
</p><p>
There aren&rsquo;t very many new conventions to learn about when using the 
<i>Desktop Manager</i> because its user interface is so well integrated with 
the other Lisa programs. It has some new components, however, not used by any 
of the other programs, though many of these already have been mentioned in 
previous chapters. To use the <i>Desktop Manager</i> effectively, you need only 
learn about an icon&rsquo;s properties, then explore the functional icons present 
on the desktop.
</p><p class=caption>
Icon properties
</p><p>
The icons you control on the desktop &ndash; folder icons and the various kinds 
of document icons (<i>LisaWrite</i> documents, <i>LisaList</i> documents, etc.) &ndash; 
have several properties you must understand to simplify operation of the 
<i>Desktop Manager.</i> This isn&rsquo;t difficult, because most of these properties 
are things you probably already associate with a document, whether it&rsquo;s an 
electronic document or an ordinary paper one. Beginning with the properties 
easiest to understand and progressing to the more complex ones, these properties are:
</p><p>
<b>Name.</b> All icons have a name. This name is centered immediately below the 
icon when the icon is on the screen. In many cases, the name is actually wider 
than the icon itself. This poses no problem; the name still is centered under 
the icon. This name can consist of any sequence of characters available on Lisa as 
long as the sequence is less than sixty-three characters in length, and doesn&rsquo;t 
contain any special formatting characters, such as tabs or carriage returns. So, 
if you want to name an icon &ldquo;&pound; Quotations&rdquo; or &ldquo;&beta; 
results from experiment,&rdquo; you can do so.
</p><p>
How do you name an icon? Simply select the icon and start typing. The letters you 
type become the name. (Actually, this is, in a way, completely consistent with 
the manner in which any text is entered into any Lisa program. When an icon 
is selected, its name is highlighted. As in any other program, if you type 
when text is currently selected, the typed text completely replaces the selected 
text.) The name of an icon can be edited just like any piece of text. Note that 
when the mouse-controlled cursor passes over the name of a selected icon, it 
automatically changes from the standard pointing arrow cursor to the text cursor. 
With this text cursor, you can edit the icon&rsquo;s name as if it were any 
text string, cutting and pasting as much as desired, with only the two 
restrictions noted above regarding length and formatting characters.
</p><p>
Even micro diskette icons can be named. These names are recorded on the diskette 
itself and can help you keep track of which disk is inserted in Lisa&rsquo;s 
diskette drive. This icon name is conceptually different from the name you write 
on the plastic case of the diskette, although most people will use the 
same name in each place.
</p><p>
<b>Size.</b> A document or folder icon, regardless of type, represents a file on a 
disk (either a diskette or one of Lisa&rsquo;s hard disks). That file and icon 
have a certain size. You can find out an icon&rsquo;s current size in several 
ways, each of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Regardless of which 
method you use, the icon&rsquo;s size is given as the number of blocks it 
occupies. (A &ldquo;block&rdquo; represents about 500 characters, whether on a hard 
disk or floppy disk.) You should pay attention to the size of an icon because 
icons of more than about 700 blocks won&rsquo;t fit conveniently on one 
diskette. The amount of free space you must have on your hard disk also depends 
on the size of your icons. (Realistically, this will not be a problem for 
single-document icons, but it is very easy for a folder icon &ndash; whose size 
is the sum of the sizes of the icons it contains, to reach these limits.)
</p><p>
<b>Password.</b> Lisa has no notion of &ldquo;logging on&rdquo; or of the 
identification of the person using it. It does, however, provide password protection 
for individual documents in case more than one person uses a single Lisa. When 
a password is required for access to a document (how to do this is explained 
later), you must type the correct password in a special Dialog Box before the 
document will open. A word of caution, however, to those who want to 
password-protect every document: If you forget the password to a file, the 
only way to recover the file is to send it to Apple headquarters in 
California, where special password-breaking programs exist &ndash; assuming that 
they have the time and inclination to help you, that is. Don&rsquo;t overuse the 
password-protection scheme to the extent that you risk forgetting passwords. In fact, 
it probably is better to use passwords only when they&rsquo;re absolutely required.
</p><p>
<b>Home.</b> Every icon has a &ldquo;home&rdquo; &ndash; in a folder, on 
a diskette, or on a hard disk. When you activate the <b>Save and Put Away</b> 
command, the icon will be put away in its home. Locating it again can be 
somewhat tricky, especially if you store something in a folder named &ldquo;Useful 
Stuff,&rdquo; which is inside a folder named &ldquo;Miscellaneous,&rdquo; which 
is inside a folder named &ldquo;Save This Folder,&rdquo; which is on the 
second of three Profiles you have. An icon&rsquo;s first home depends on the 
manner in which it is created, and each of the several cases will be outlined 
in this chapter when they occur. The most important thing to remember is 
that merely positioning the icon on the desktop will not change its home. 
An icon whose home is on a diskette will still have its home on diskette after 
you move it to the desktop. You can change an icon&rsquo;s home only by moving 
it to a new home &ndash; another disk or folder. You can become quite confused by 
certain actions on the desktop, if you don&rsquo;t understand the notion of an 
icon&rsquo;s home.
</p><p>
<b>Reference.</b> On Lisa&rsquo;s desktop you can arrange the icons you&rsquo;ll 
be working with spatially. This may help you remember that one icon is different 
from another icon because they are in different places, even if they have the 
same name. The <i>Desktop Manager,</i> however, must have a set of unique names 
for all icons. This name is called the icon&rsquo;s &ldquo;reference.&rdquo; You 
may need to manipulate this reference to use some non-Apple software. How to 
do this is explained later in this chapter.

Function icons

Many icons graphically represent certain <i>Desktop Manager</i> tasks. These 
include stationery pads, the trash can, preferences (the Lisa icon), the 
clock/calendar, the clipboard, and the calculator (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig121'>Figure 12-1</a>).
</p><p>
<b>Stationery pads.</b> Stationery pads, which exist for folders as well as 
for every type of Lisa paper, represent the command to create a new file. On 
Lisa, however, this command is reduced to the notion of tearing off a piece of 
paper from a pad. When activated (in one of two manners, to be discussed 
shortly), a stationery pad will generate a new document or folder and place this 
new desktop citizen slightly to the left and slightly above the pad from 
which it was torn. If the name of the pad is <i>&ldquo;LisaWrite Paper&rdquo;</i> 
for example, the name of the generated document will be the name of the pad 
with the current date appended &ndash; <i>&ldquo;LisaWrite Paper 11/21.&rdquo;</i>
</p><p>
You should not be restricted to thinking that stationery pads and the 
documents they generate must be blank documents. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. As you will soon see, any document can be made into a stationery pad. 
If you design an invoice for your company using <i>LisaDraw,</i> for example, you 
can make that document into a stationery pad and tear off a &ldquo;sheet&rdquo;
when you need to generate an invoice.
</p><p>
<b>Trash Can.</b> On many systems, the command to delete files is a slightly 
scary command. Incorrectly typing a letter or two can result in
the destruction of one or more files you had no intention of deleting. This can 
never happen on Lisa, for two reasons. The first reason has to do with the way 
you indicate to the <i>Desktop Manager</i> that a file should be deleted. You 
don&rsquo;t designate a file indirectly by typing its name. Rather, you (in 
effect) pick up that file directly and deposit it into the Trash Can icon. 
There is no typing of file names &ndash; with resulting errors that inadvertently 
delete a file. The second reason is that even if you put the wrong icon into 
the Trash Can (an extremely rare occurrence), you can always reach into the 
Trash Can and pull it back out.
</p><p>
Now, you needn&rsquo;t move every file separately to the Trash Can. You can 
move whole folders of icons at once. Or, you can make an extended selection 
of icons in essentially the same manner you do an extended selection in <i>LisaDraw,</i> 
and move the extended selection to the Trash Can. You can select several icons 
at once by holding down the Shift key while selecting the icons with the mouse, 
or by drawing a selection rectangle on the screen. (To do this, hold the 
mouse button in an area of the desktop that is empty. If you now move the mouse 
while continuing to press the button, you can draw a selection box on the screen. 
All icons that are completely inside this box when you release the mouse button will 
be selected.) Once a set of icons is selected, to discard them, you need only 
depress the mouse button on any part of the set and, keeping the mouse button 
pressed, move the cursor to the Trash Can. As you move the cursor, outlines 
of all the selected icons will follow.
</p><p>
One really great feature about the Trash Can deserves special mention. You can 
open the Trash Can (by double-clicking the mouse on the Trash Can icon &ndash; the 
same way you open any icon) and pull out any document contained in there. What 
will reside in the Trash Can is the last set of icons you dumped in there. 
Whenever you dump something else in the Trash Can, whether it is a single icon 
or a set of icons, whatever was already in the Trash Can is deleted. You 
can retrieve anything from the very last set of icons you dumped into the Trash 
Can, but nothing from any previous set.

<b>Preferences.</b> Many things about your Lisa are different from anyone 
else&rsquo;s Lisa. You may want Lisa&rsquo;s &ldquo;beep&rdquo; (or &ldquo;joyful 
noise&rdquo;) to be very loud. You may have both an internal 10MB disk and an 
external Profile. You may want the repeating keys on the keyboard to react 
really fast. These and many other things describe your preferences for
configuring your Lisa. On many computers, setting these individual preferences 
involves a rather detailed knowledge of the operating system and sometimes even the 
need to take the machine apart to modify its internals. Not on Lisa.
</p><p>
Lisa&rsquo;s <i>Desktop Manager</i> provides these sorts of functions through the 
icon that looks like Lisa itself, the icon labeled &ldquo;Preferences.&rdquo; Opening 
this icon presents you with a Dialog Box with five choices: <b>Set Conveniences, 
Select Defaults, Connect Device Software, Install Device Software,</b> and 
<b>Remove Device Software.</b> Checking any of these results in the display 
of several more choices.
</p><p>
The choices in <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig122'>Figure 12-2</a> are the convenience settings. These allow you 
to set various display and typing parameters to your personal preferences (hence the 
name).
</p><p>
The <b>Select Defaults</b> option on the Preferences window allows you to pick which 
of the several disks on Lisa is to be used when Lisa is first turned on. Any 
disks on the system will be presented to you as choices, including the micro 
diskette and however many hard disks are on the system. This option also enables 
you to choose between a thorough memory test that lasts about 60 seconds whenever 
Lisa is turned on, or a brief memory test that lasts about 30 seconds.

The Connect Device Software Dialog Box (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig123'>Figure 12-3</a>) provides you with 
an unbelievably easy-to-use method for installing new hardware and for establishing 
which software is used to connect a new device with Lisa. You would use 
this Dialog Box, for example, to tell Lisa that your recently purchased laser 
printer is installed in one of the serial ports. You would use the next option, 
<b>Install Device Software,</b> to install the software that would enable Lisa 
to communicate correctly with this new device. This is one of the truly 
sophisticated portions of the <i>Desktop Manager.</i> It is designed so that 
when new devices are manufactured they can be packaged together with a micro 
diskette containing the software that enables Lisa to use them. This 
means that major revisions of the <i>Desktop Manager</i> need not occur just 
because a new product is announced, making it easy for other hardware 
manufacturers to produce products that work with Lisa &ndash; an excellent idea 
for everyone, especially you, the Lisa user.
</p><p>
The last option in the Preferences window enables you to remove software that is 
no longer needed.
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig124'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 12-4: The clock/calendar window.' title='Figure 12-4: The clock/calendar window.' src='pics/books/thecompletebookoflisa/fig124.jpg'></a></td></tr><tr><td class=imagecaption><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig124'><img border=0 align=right width=12 height=12 alt='This image can be zoomed' title='This image can be zoomed' style='margin-top: 3px; margin-left: 5px' src='intr/zoom.gif'></a>Figure 12-4: The clock/calendar window.</td></tr></table>
<b>Clock/Calendar.</b> The <i>Desktop Manager</i> keeps the time and date using 
the Clock/Calendar icon. This icon enables the Desktop Manager to label documents 
with their date and time of creation as well as date and time of the last 
modification. This is extremely useful in keeping track of different versions of 
large, multipart documents. <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig124'>Figure 12-4</a> shows the clock window. To set 
the clock (if Lisa has been unplugged for more than 10 hours or so, or you 
need to switch to or from daylight savings time), type the correct time and/or date 
on top of the time or date shown in the clock window.
</p><p>
Other than that, there isn&rsquo;t too much you can do with the clock icon. I 
typically put it away (in the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; folder with <i>LisaWrite, LisaProject,</i>
and other programs). It seems to take up more space on the desktop than it is worth.
</p><p>
<b>Clipboard.</b> The clipboard is a temporary storage location for any of 
the types of information that can be manipulated on Lisa. When you use the 
<b>Cut, Copy,</b> or <b>Paste</b> commands on any <i>Edit</i> menus, you really are 
using the clipboard. Material that is cut or copied is placed on the clipboard; 
pasted material is copied from the clipboard.
</p><p>
If you are ever unsure what is currently on the clipboard, you can open it 
to double-check. However, once it&rsquo;s opened, you can do nothing else with 
the clipboard contents. You cannot edit the material stored there in any way.
</p><p>
If it were up to me, I would put my clipboard in the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; folder 
along with the clock/calendar. On those rare occasions when I need to open 
it, I would go and get it. Unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t up to me, or to you, 
for that matter. The Clipboard icon is one of several permanent desktop 
residents. The Clipboard, Preferences, Trash Can, and hard-disk icons (the 
internal 10-megabyte hard disk and the Profile) cannot be removed from the desktop.

<b>Calculator.</b> One of the nicest utilities the Desktop Manager provides 
is a calculator. <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig125'>Figure 12-5</a> shows one of the three types of calculators 
provided on Lisa, the four-function calculator. In addition to this 
calculator, there also is a &ldquo;reverse-Polish&rdquo; calculator and an 
&ldquo;adding machine.&rdquo; You use any of these by &ldquo;pressing&rdquo; 
the keys with the mouse-controlled cursor. The results show on both the 
calculator&rsquo;s display and the optional &ldquo;tape&rdquo; to the right 
of the calculator. A special set of menus associated with the calculator 
enables you to select which type of calculator you want to use, show or 
hide the tape, set the format for the numbers to be displayed, and cut 
and paste information from the calculator to the clipboard, and vice versa. 
In <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig126'>Figure 12-6</a>, the calculator window has the tape showing, in the 
middle of a long calculation.
</p><p>
One interesting characteristic of the calculator is that it &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; 
the calculations after you close the window. You may be in the middle 
of a calculation, have to stop for some reason that requires that you close 
the window, then open it later and continue the calculation as if nothing had 
interrupted you; you need not write down intermediate results on a scrap 
of paper if you are interrupted. In addition, with the cutting and pasting that 
is possible, you can attach &ldquo;adding machine tapes&rdquo; to a report showing 
your calculations, backing up the results in the report. If you don&rsquo;t 
need to save the intermediate results, you can erase the calculator and tape.

<b>Hard disk.</b> Two hard-disk icons correspond, respectively, to the 
internal 10-megabyte hard disk and the external 5-megabyte Profile. These icons 
look different, but act exactly the same. When one is opened, you are presented 
with a list (in one of three formats, explained below) of the contents of 
that hard disk. Note that you can have at most one 10-megabyte icon because 
you can have at most one 10-megabyte disk drive, but you can have multiple Profile 
icons. All of these icons reside permanently on the desktop.
</p><p class=caption>
Commands and menus
</p><p>
To be as consistent as possible with other Lisa programs, the Desktop Manager has 
a customized set of pull-down menus. The titles of these menus are displayed 
along the menu title bar whenever there is no active window on the screen. 
These titles are:

The Desk menu

Because the <i>Desk</i> menu varies from Lisa to Lisa, yours won&rsquo;t necessarily look like this.</td></tr></table>
The <i>Desk</i> menu lets you open any icon on the desktop or tear off any 
piece of stationery without having to touch the icon directly with the cursor. 
Every icon on the desktop is listed in the <i>Desk</i> menu when it is 
pulled down, so the exact menu will vary from Lisa to Lisa, and even 
from time to time on the same Lisa. An example of one <i>Desk</i> menu (mine) is 
shown in <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig127'>Figure 12-7</a>. The most important use of the <i>Desk</i> menu 
is to provide you with a means of opening up an icon while your screen is 
covered with some other work. Otherwise, you&rsquo;d have to resize or move many 
windows to find specific icons.
</p><p class=caption>
The File/Print menu
</p><p>
The <i>Desktop Manager File/Print</i> menu (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig128'>Figure 12-8</a>) differs significantly 
from the standard <i>File/Print</i> menu discussed in Chapter Three,
because you perform types of filing and printing from the <i>Desktop Manager</i> 
different from those of the other programs.
</p><p>
Of the first command set &ndash; <b>Set Aside Everything</b> and <b>Set 
Aside (Document)</b> &ndash; only the former usually is active. As discussed 
in Chapter Three, this command closes all open windows and places the icons 
of those windows on the desktop. It does not, however, cause the editing 
changes made since the last time you saved the document to be recorded 
on disk. So, if there were a power failure or if a software problem required you
to turn off Lisa without the normal shutdown procedure, these changes would be 
lost. The principal use of <b>Set Aside Everything</b> is to clear off the screen quickly.
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=left class=screenshotmarginleft><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig128'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 12-8: The Desktop Manager File/Print menu.' title='Figure 12-8: The Desktop Manager File/Print menu.' src='pics/books/thecompletebookoflisa/fig128.jpg'></a></td></tr><tr><td class=imagecaption><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig128'><img border=0 align=right width=12 height=12 alt='This image can be zoomed' title='This image can be zoomed' style='margin-top: 3px; margin-left: 5px' src='intr/zoom.gif'></a>Figure 12-8: The <i>Desktop Manager File/Print</i> menu.</td></tr></table>
The second set of commands, the largest on the <i>File/Print</i> menu, deals 
with a variety of tasks concerning the copying and storing of Lisa documents. 
As in the general <i>File/Print</i> menu, <b>Save and Put Away</b> saves the 
recent changes made to the selected icon and then returns that icon to its 
home. <b>Open,</b> of course, opens a window to that document.
</p><p>
<b>Duplicate</b> is one of the more powerful commands in the <i>Desktop Manager.</i> It 
is used to make a duplicate copy of a document, back up the Profile or 
internal 10-megabyte hard disk, or back up one micro diskette to another. 
Basically, to use <b>Duplicate,</b> you select the icon you
wish to duplicate (document, folder, diskette, or hard disk), then activate 
<b>Duplicate.</b> A blinking duplicate icon of the one you selected appears 
slightly lower and to the right of the original. You must then move that blinking 
icon to its new home to complete the duplication process. If you move the 
blinking icon to a blank spot on the desktop, the duplicate will have the same 
home as the original.
</p><p>

These provide you with useful information about documents, folders, and disks. Of particular importance is the ability to set document passwords and sizes.</td></tr></table>
The <b>Attributes of...</b> command enables you to find out an icon&rsquo;s home, 
determine the number of blocks it currently occupies, and password-protect 
the icon (or change the current password). As with any command ending 
in &ldquo;...,&rdquo; its activation results in the display of a Dialog 
Box (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig129'>Figure 12-9</a>). The password protection of a document is
the most important purpose of this Dialog Box for documents, and the size 
reading is the most important for disks, both micro diskettes and hard 
disks. Once protected by a password, a document cannot be opened, duplicated, 
or deleted unless the password is entered correctly. Recall that if you forget the 
password that protects a file, you can do almost nothing to recover the information.
</p><p>
<b>Tear Off Stationery</b> is active whenever the current selection is a stationery 
pad. It has exactly the same effect as the other two methods of tearing off 
stationery: double-clicking on a stationery pad and activating the name of 
a stationery pad in the <i>Desk</i> menu. <b>Make Stationery Pad</b> is active 
any time a document is selected. When activated, this command turns the selected 
document into a pad. This document can be of any length or size. Once a document 
is made into a stationery pad, there is no direct way to change it back into a 
regular document. The effect of changing it change back can be accomplished 
easily, however, by tearing of a piece of stationery and then throwing away the pad.
</p><p>
<b>Backing up the hard disk.</b> It is very important to back up the contents 
of Lisa&rsquo;s hard disks periodically in case some catastrophic event makes a 
disk unusable. (Although such events are rare, they can be very expensive 
because of the cost of redoing all the work stored on the disk. The back-up 
procedure is easy, making it very cheap insurance.) To back up a Profile or the 
10-megabyte internal disk, you need a number of micro diskettes (usually between 
four and twenty, depending on which hard disk you have and how full it is). To 
start the process, insert the first diskette, then Duplicate the hard-disk 
icon and move the blinking duplicate to the diskette icon. The Desktop Manager 
automatically prompts you when the diskette is full, at which point you insert 
the next diskette. This continues until the entire disk is backed up.
</p><p>
The first time you back up the hard disk, its entire contents will be 
copied to the diskettes. Thereafter, you will be given a choice of a full 
or incremental back-up. A full back-up copies the entire contents of the 
disk; an incremental back-up copies only those documents modified since the last full 
or incremental back-up. So, you may need many diskettes for a full back-up, but 
only a few for an incremental one.
</p><p>
The back-up procedure has one problem: It clears off the desktop. If y
ou have carefully designed the placement of certain icons around the desktop, the 
back-up procedure will return each icon to its respective home. Because 
I see no reason why this must occur, I consider it to be a bug. Even if 
there is some reason why it must occur during the back-up process, it is a nuisance.
</p><p>
How often should you back up a hard disk? It depends on a number
of variables. If your Lisa is used by several people and if important information 
is kept on hard disk, back-up should be done at least weekly and maybe more 
frequently. If you are the only person using your Lisa, you may choose to manage 
your own back-up process, rather than let the <i>Desktop Manager</i> do it 
for you. To manage your own back-up, periodically <b>Duplicate</b> the files 
you have been working with to diskettes. This provides you with an extra copy 
of your important files. When I use Lisa heavily (more than 5 hours a day), 
I back up daily and manage my own back-up. This takes less than 10 minutes, 
and the peace of mind it gives is well worth the time it takes.
</p><p>
Regardless of which back-up procedure you use and at what frequency, you 
should back up all files. There is an ancient (more than 3 years old) saying 
in computer science: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have at least two copies of 
a document, you don&rsquo;t really care about losing it.&rdquo; This expresses 
the cumulative wisdom of all those who have accidentally erased files, had 
disks become unreadable, or mistakenly modified important files.
</p><p>
<b>Backing up programs.</b> It is a good idea to back up the Lisa programs. 
Although you always have the diskettes on which the programs were delivered, diskettes 
do wear out or otherwise &ldquo;go bad.&rdquo; I have experienced the problem 
of reinstalling a program from the original diskette, only to have that 
reinstallation procedure fail because the original diskette had become 
unreadable. To back up the programs, <b>Duplicate</b> the program, its stationery 
pad, and its example folder to a blank diskette. This procedure provides you 
with a back-up of the program that can be reinstalled on your Lisa, but on 
no other Lisa, because the back-up contains the serial number of your Lisa 
and the software is designed not to work on a machine with any other serial number.
</p><p>
<b>Passwords are case-sensitive.</b> The passwords you assign to documents 
using <b>Attributes of...</b> are case-sensitive. This means that the word you 
choose must be used in exactly the same way each time, including upper- and 
lower-case letters. For example, each of the following passwords is considered 
to be completely different: &ldquo;kittypie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kittypie,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;KittyPie,&rdquo; and &ldquo;KITTYPIE.&rdquo; You must either remember 
the exact case of each letter, or always use the same case for all passwords.

The Edit menu (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig1210'>Figure 12-10</a>) provides you with the ability to cut and 
paste text when you use the <i>Desktop Manager.</i> Thanks to Lisa&rsquo;s 
extensive use of menus, that is not a very frequent occurrence, but when 
it happens, it is handled just like the text editing in any Lisa program. 
(If this seems so natural and reasonable to you that it hardly deserves mention, 
you probably haven&rsquo;t used conventional computers much. Typically, you 
must learn two or three different ways to edit text &ndash; one way when using 
the operating system, another when using the text editor, yet another when 
using the spreadsheet, etc. After using Lisa you will wonder why so many people 
have put up with such difficult conditions for so long.) The commands <b>Cut, 
Copy,</b> and <b>Paste</b> work exactly as you would expect when dealing with 
icon names and passwords, the two basic text-editing tasks in the <i>Desktop Manager.</i>
</p><p>
Three other commands are on the <i>Edit</i> menu: <b>Undo Last Change, Select 
All Icons,</b> and <b>Copy Reference.</b> As you&rsquo;d expect, <b>Undo 
Last Change</b> lets you back out of any text editing action on the desktop. 
You cannot, however, undo most other desktop actions, such as putting an 
icon in a folder, changing the folder organization (see <i>Housekeeping</i> 
menu below), or tearing off stationery. <b>Select All Icons</b> selects all 
icons on the desktop, if there is no open folder or active window. If a folder 
or disk (either diskette or hard disk) is open and its window is active, 
<b>Select All Icons</b> selects only those icons inside the active window. 
(Note: It is impossible even to view, let alone activate, the command 
<b>Select All Icons</b> if the active window is an open document. When 
the active window is a document, only that document&rsquo;s program menus are 
available and none of the programs&rsquo; <i>Edit</i> menus displays 
<b>Select All Icons.</b>)
</p><p>
<b>Copy Reference</b> is the most unusual of all commands on the 
<i>Desktop Manager.</i> If the programs we discussed so far are the only 
software you have on your Lisa, this command will be of no use. If, however, you
have additional software that runs on the Lisa desktop, <b>Copy Reference</b> 
communicates to that software the name of an icon. Suppose, for example, you had 
a program that analyzed <i>LisaWrite</i> documents for grammar mistakes, clarity 
of style, verbosity, and so on. When you used this program, you&rsquo;d need 
a way to tell it to analyze a particular document. Merely typing in the name 
of the document is not sufficient, because you may have two documents of 
the same name on the desktop.
</p><p>
Although unseen by you, there are document names Lisa uses to distinguish the 
various documents you have generated. <b>Copy Reference</b> lets you copy this 
name to the Clipboard, so that you can then paste it in place in the 
special-purpose software. To do this, select the document, then activate 
<b>Copy Reference.</b> The Clipboard will then contain this special name. After 
you use Copy Reference, however, you can&rsquo;t open the clipboard to see this 
hidden name. What you will see there is a mini-icon representing the icon, 
followed by your name for this document, not the special name used internally 
by Lisa.
</p><p>
<b>Duplicating a micro diskette onto hard disk.</b> To transfer the entire contents 
of a diskette to a hard disk, you cannot simply select the diskette icon 
and <b>Duplicate</b> it to the hard disk, because this action would back up 
the diskette to the hard disk, <i>erasing</i> the hard disk. To copy all of a 
diskette&rsquo;s contents to a hard disk, open the diskette, activate 
<b>Select All Icons</b> to select every document on the diskette, then 
<b>Duplicate</b> to the hard disk.

The Housekeeping menu (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig1211'>Figure 12-11</a>) is used to control the diskette and 
the trash can, as well as the display format for folders.
</p><p>
You do not have direct access to the diskette once it is inserted in Lisa&rsquo;s 
disk drive. At most, you can &ldquo;suggest&rdquo; to Lisa that it should 
be released. This is done with the <b>Eject Micro Diskette</b> command, the 
first command of the <i>Housekeeping</i> menu. When you activate this, the <i>Desktop 
Manager</i> will ensure that all the documents whose homes are on the diskette 
currently in the disk drive will be returned to the diskette, along with any 
changes you made to those documents. It is impossible for you to eject 
the diskette and forget to update the documents with the changes you made. Knowing 
this, it is easy to understand the only case in which Lisa will not follow 
your suggestion that the diskette be ejected: when the changes you made exceed 
the disk&rsquo;s storage capacity (approximately 700 blocks, or about 400,000 
characters). Luckily, with diskettes of this capacity, this problem is not 
encountered often.
</p><p>
The next three commands of the <i>Housekeeping</i> menu enable you to pick the 
display format for folders or diskettes. These formats are:

<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig1212'>Figure 12-12</a> shows these three arrangements for the same folder, obtained 
with the <b>Pictorial View, Alphabetical View,</b> and <b>Chronological View</b> 
commands, respectively. Once set, this format choice is retained by the 
folder or diskette until you change it. If you use the pictorial view and 
want the icons lined up straight in the folder or diskette, the last command 
in this set, <b>Straighten Up Icons,</b> will accomplish this. Unfortunately, this 
command doesn&rsquo;t take into account the length of the name of an icon 
in this straightening process. In documents with long names, the names may overlap 
in this straightened view.
</p><p>
The next two <i>Housekeeping</i> commands enable you to correct an error in 
a micro diskette or erase a diskette completely. From time to time, the 
internal structure of a diskette may be damaged. This happens from a 
variety of causes, including improper storage and handling, defects in the 
disk itself, and normal wear and tear. When damage is detected, Lisa informs 
you that there is a problem and suggests that the diskette surface be repaired. 
This usually can be accomplished by the <b>Repair Disk</b> command. When you 
wish to erase a diskette completely, it is better to do so by using 
the <b>Erase Disk</b> command than by removing all the disk&rsquo;s files, 
because the erase operation also effects the same type of internal check 
of the disk&rsquo;s structure performed with <b>Repair Disk.</b>
</p><p>
The last command of the <i>Housekeeping</i> menu allows you to control the 
actions of the trash can. Recall that the contents of the trash can are really 
erased from disk only when you deposit the next set of icons into the trash 
can. This has two consequences: The disk storage space of the icons you threw 
into the trash can is not immediately recovered when the documents are thrown 
away; and the amount of time it takes to throw away a document depends 
on what you <i>last</i> threw away, since that older document must be deleted 
first. In this situation, you may feel Lisa, not you, is in control. The 
<b>Erase Wastebasket</b> command gives control back to you. Activating this 
command deletes everything currently in the trash can.
</p><p>
<b>When to use the various folder and disk formats.</b> The folder and disk 
formats each have their special strengths and weaknesses. I have found the formats 
to be best in the following situations:
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100% class=list><tr><td width=16><img width=16 height=9 src='intr/liststart.png'></td></tr><tr><td width=16 background='intr/listfill.png' valign=top><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=16 height=15 src='intr/listbullet.png'></td><td width=100%><table width=100% class=list cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign=top width=5 valign=middle><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=5 height=15 src='intr/listbulletfill.png'></td><td class=content width=100%><b>Pictorial View.</b> Best used when small sets of icons are logically arranged 
in groups and you don&rsquo;t want to use folders for groups. You may use this 
view when you want complete control over the order and placement of icons in

the desktop itself.

need to see the documents most recently modified &ndash; again, to assist 
you in managing your own back-up.

<b>More on the trash can.</b> The explanations of the trash can functions presented 
up to now have been correct but incomplete. In determining when the trash can 
is really emptied, an additional factor is taken into account: the icon&rsquo;s 
home. An icon (or set of icons) whose home is on Disk A will be erased when the 
next icon (or set of icons) whose home is also on Disk A is dumped into the trash 
can. This holds true whether Disk A is a Profile, the 10-megabyte internal disk, 
or a micro diskette. So, if you dump into the trash can icons whose home is 
on a particular diskette to make room on that diskette for other material, 
you haven&rsquo;t really made room on that diskette, even if you then throw 
away something else on the hard disk. You can observe this by checking the attributes 
of the diskette. The amount of free space will be unchanged until you throw 
away someting else on that diskette or until you activate <b>Erase Wastebasket.</b>

Operating speed
</p><p>
The <i>Desktop Manager</i> determines the speed of many operations on Lisa. Such 
operations include tearing off a piece of stationery, opening a <i>LisaWrite</i> 
document, opening the Profile icon, initializing a diskette, or duplicating, 
saving, and putting away a document. Some operations whose speeds are not determined 
by the <i>Desktop Manager</i> include printing a document (this is usually determined 
by the speed of the printer), moving from the beginning to the end of 
a large <i>LisaWrite</i> document, sorting a <i>LisaList</i> list, and recalculating 
a <i>LisaCalc</i> spreadsheet.
</p><p>
Some speeds determined by the Desktop Manager include:

These times don&rsquo;t include the most common operation performed with 
the <i>Desktop Manager,</i> opening up a window, because those speeds depend 
on two other factors: whether a program has been used since the last time 
Lisa was turned on, and whether a document has been saved and put away 
or simply set aside on the desktop. The following table illustrates these speeds:
