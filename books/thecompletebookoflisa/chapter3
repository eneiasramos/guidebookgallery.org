Most personal computer system descriptions include in-depth examinations of their 
hardware, featuring an abundance of computer jargon: motherboard, bus, RAM, I/O 
board, card slot, backplane, and on and on. This is generally of little use, unless 
you plan to write programs.
</p><p>
Exactly how much memory a system has, for example, is irrelevant. What is important 
is whether there is a good business-graphics program, what size spreadsheets 
can be manipulated, how large documents can be, what types of type styles can 
be printed, and exactly what characters can be used in creating text. Also important 
are the number of colors that can be displayed on a color screen and the number 
of shading patterns available on a monochrome screen.
</p><p>
Today&rsquo;s computer users are concerned about what a system can do for them and 
at what speed, price, and accuracy. What really matters is whether Computer System 
X can manipulate spreadsheets of 250 rows by 250 columns. Similarly, screen 
resolution is not as important as whether a document appears on the screen exactly 
as it will print. Screen size isn&rsquo;t as important as how much of an 
8-&frac12;&rdquo;&times;11&rdquo; page can be displayed at once.
</p><p>
Not that Lisa&rsquo;s technical specifications aren&rsquo;t impressive. Lisa&rsquo;s 
memory capacity, for example, is more than one million bytes &ndash; much more 
than any other personal computer. The processor used inside Lisa is extremely 
powerful. Although it is difficult to describe its power accurately without using 
technical terms, one can use the processor&rsquo;s &ldquo;width&rdquo; (the number 
of bits it can process simultaneously) as a rough measure of power. The Apple II has 
an 8-bit processor, the IBM PC a 16-bit processor; both Lisa and Macintosh have 
32-bit processors. Another impressive specification is Lisa&rsquo;s screen; it 
contains more than 262,000 distinct dots, each of which can be changed from white to 
black sixty times a second.
</p><p>
Back to what Lisa can <i>do.</i> Seven programs are now available from Apple, and 
many other programs are available from independent software vendors; the 
number of independently produced programs is growing regularly. In addition, there 
is the <i>Desktop Operating System,</i> the environment on which all seven application 
programs work. The <i>Desktop Operating System</i> is explained fully in Chapter Twelve.
</p><p>
The seven programs from Apple include:

</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><img width=16 height=8 src='intr/listend.png'></td></tr></table></p><p>
In addition, there are programming languages and programming environments available 
for Lisa. Combined, the applications programs listed above cover the vast 
majority of tasks typically performed on personal computers by professionals.
</p><p>
These seven programs are excellent, useful tools in and of themselves, but Lisa 
is based on more than just these seven programs. This is because there is a 
difference between computer &ldquo;utility&rdquo; and &ldquo;usability.&rdquo; 
The utility of a computer refers to its ability to accomplish a specific range 
of tasks &ndash; what the machine can do, rather than what you must do to use 
it. One computer might have the ability to print italic letters, for example, 
but to do this you might have to enter six cryptic commands in a rigid order. In 
contrast, usability refers to a computer&rsquo;s ability to let you 
accomplish tasks easily and effectively with acceptable levels of effort, comfort, 
and satisfaction &ndash; how the machine assists you in completing the job at 
hand. With most computers, utility and usability don&rsquo;t necessarily go hand 
in hand. With Lisa, they do, enabling your work to be accomplished with ease.
</p><p>
But Lisa&rsquo;s <i>real</i> value comes from its program integration.
</p><p>
A set of programs is said to be integrated when data from one program can be 
used without change, or with very little change, in other programs. This 
transferability is, unfortunately, not yet the norm in most computer systems, large 
or small.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Full integration&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean every program is compatible with 
every other program. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense, for example, to try to integrate 
graphic data from <i>LisaDraw</i> with the spreadsheets of <i>LisaCalc; LisaCalc</i> 
does not have (nor should it have) the ability to process drawings. It does make 
sense, however, to integrate <i>LisaDraw</i> graphics with <i>LisaWrite</i> documents, 
because text and pictures often go hand in hand; to integrate <i>LisaList</i> data 
with <i>LisaWrite</i> documents to add tables to text; or to integrate <i>LisaCalc</i>
spreadsheets with <i>LisaGraph</i> bar charts to create an effective presentation 
of graphics and text. Lisa allows these types of integration as well as many others.
</p><p>
Being fully integrated isn&rsquo;t enough, however. To be truly usable by both 
novices and experts, software must be easy to understand and use &ndash; a function 
known in computer jargon as good &ldquo;user interface.&rdquo; The user interface 
is the sum total of everything you must do or know about a software program to 
accomplish the task at hand. This typically includes the commands you need 
to know to get things done; the actual buttons you must press and in what order to 
enter, manipulate, and retrieve data; and the error messages you get when something 
isn&rsquo;t quite right. The key to good user interface is consistency &ndash; 
all concepts, functions, and procedures must apply to all programs. A high-quality 
user interface lets you learn one set of commands that may be used with many 
different programs. In general, a high-quality interface is one that:

A computer system with as many diverse applications as Lisa has a large user 
interface &ndash; large in that there is a great deal for the new Lisa user
to learn. In the pages that follow, I&rsquo;ll simplify that learning process by 
explaining how Lisa works and how to get the most out of each program.
</p><p>
One of the first things you&rsquo;ll discover about Lisa is that the consistency 
of software design shortens dramatically the time it takes to learn a 
new program. This &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; maximizes the value of your intuition. 
(&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet this will work here in <i>LisaGraph</i> the same as it did 
in <i>LisaCalc.</i> Let&rsquo;s try it.&rdquo;) Once you learn, for example, how 
to delete a row in a <i>LisaList</i> table, you&rsquo;ll know how to delete 
rows in <i>LisaCalc</i> spreadsheets and <i>LisaGraph</i> data tables. The 
&ldquo;delete-row&rdquo; operation works exactly the same in each program.
</p><p>
New application programs become easier to learn, because each time a new program 
is learned, the core concepts behind all applications can be practiced 
further. Conversely, an inconsistent user interface would doom you to an 
almost endless learning process, with each new program as difficult to learn as the last.
</p><p class=caption>
Three general principles
</p><p>
Three general principles apply to all Lisa programs: &ldquo;selection, then 
operation,&rdquo; &ldquo;cursor shape shows expected action,&rdquo; and &ldquo;stationery 
pads provide access to programs.&rdquo; By observing these principles, you 
can easily transfer your experiences from one program to another.
</p><p>
<b>Selection, then operation.</b> This means that for almost anything you do, 
you must first select, usually using the mouse, the object to be affected. 
In Lisa, the selection process is easy because the material you select becomes highlighted 
on the screen, usually by its white portions changing to black and its 
black portions to white &ndash; what we&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;reverse video.&rdquo; 
This visual feedback enables you to verify what you&rsquo;ve selected. All 
objects become highlighted when selected: text in <i>LisaWrite,</i> designs 
in <i>LisaDraw,</i> bars in <i>LisaGraph,</i> columns in <i>LisaList,</i> deadlines 
in <i>LisaProject,</i> and formulas in <i>LisaCalc,</i> among many other things. 
When you next specify a command to perform on the selected material, you&rsquo;ll 
know precisely what material will be affected.
</p><p>
One advantage of this &ldquo;selection, then operation&rdquo; principle is 
that the system can protect you from requesting impossible or nonsensical 
operations. Lisa can deactivate any commands that do not apply. Example: 
The <b>Erase Disk</b> command isn&rsquo;t active unless you have selected the icon 
representing one of the three types of Lisa disks: the removable
micro diskette, the external Profile hard disk, or the internal Winchester hard disk. 
This selective command deactivation prevents many potential disasters, especially 
for novice users.
<b>Cursor shape shows expected action.</b> Many computer systems have only 
one shape for the cursor &ndash; typically a blinking underscore or a blinking 
square. Lisa has nearly a dozen different cursor shapes, although only one 
shape is used at any given moment. The cursor shape changes automatically 
as you move the cursor over various portions of the screen. Each different 
shape indicates what you can, and cannot, do at that moment. The cursor shape used 
when text is being manipulated, for example, is used extensively in <i>LisaWrite,</i> 
Lisa&rsquo;s word processing program. It also is used in <i>LisaDraw, LisaCalc, 
LisaGraph, LisaProject, LisaList, LisaTerminal,</i> and on the Lisa desktop, 
whenever text is being manipulated. Other shapes have other universal functions:

<b>Cross-hair cursor:</b> used in <i>LisaDraw</i> when you enter a new graphic 
object, and in <i>LisaTerminal</i> when you enter tab and column stops.
<br clear=all>
</p><p>
The cursor moves on top of everything on the screen and 
changes its shape as it moves about, temporarily obscuring that small 
portion of the screen directly beneath, but not obscuring objects on the 
screen. Even this seemingly simple task of moving the cursor about unobstructed 
and without destroying the screen contents requires a significant amount of 
both memory and processing power &ndash; one of the many advantages of a 
powerful computer like Lisa.
</p><p>
<b>Stationery pads provide access to programs.</b> Each of the integrated programs 
available for Lisa is represented on the screen by an icon in the form of 
a stationery pad. To use any program, you must first &ldquo;tear&rdquo; a blank 
sheet of paper from the appropriate pad.

To use <i>LisaProject,</i> for example, you must first tear off a piece 
of paper from the <i>LisaProject</i> stationery pad, an endless supply of 
pieces of <i>LisaProject</i> paper. This tearing off operation is an easy, 
single-step operation; you simply move the mouse until the cursor is over the 
appropriate pad, then click the mouse button twice. That&rsquo;s all there is 
to it. There are no special commands to remember (and, more important, no 
commands to forget). Each type of stationery is used for a specific application: 
<i>LisaWrite</i> paper for word processing, <i>LisaCalc</i> paper for 
spreadsheets, <i>LisaGraph</i> paper for business graphics, and so on. Each type 
of paper has a distinct icon (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig32'>Figure 3-2</a>), which enables you to distinguish 
it easily on Lisa&rsquo;s desktop.
</p><p>
The stationery pad analogy may be taken only so far, however. A single <i>LisaDraw</i>
piece of paper may contain an 8&rsquo;&times;4&rsquo; drawing; a single <i>LisaList</i>
piece of paper may contain a small data base with thousands of entries; a single 
<i>LisaWrite</i> piece of paper may contain an entire chapter of a book. In other 
words, each piece of paper represents an entire document. (We&rsquo;ll use the 
terms &ldquo;document&rdquo; and &ldquo;piece of paper&rdquo; interchangably.)
</p><p>
All of this frees you from having to remember which documents are contained in 
which icons and from having to activate the specific software when you want 
access to that document. With Lisa, it is impossible to activate, say, 
the spreadsheet <i>(LisaCalc)</i> accidentally when working on a text 
document <i>(LisaWrite).</i>

On Lisa, the window moves about on top of a document, providing a portal to the document&rsquo;s contents.</td></tr></table>
When a document is opened on the screen, you are presented with a window &ndash; 
a titled, rectangular portal. You may view the contents of the document 
through this window. Because documents are usually bigger than the screen, you 
can move the window around the document, viewing different portions with each 
new screenful (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig33'>Figure 3-3</a>).
</p><p>
<b>Opening a window.</b> There are three methods of opening a window
to a document, each of which can be used with any type of document.
The first method is to use the <b>Open</b> command on the <i>File/Print</i> menu.
(More about menus later in this chapter.) The second method also
involves a menu, in this case, the <i>Desk</i> menu. This menu lists the icons
on Lisa&rsquo;s desktop. Selecting one of them from the <i>Desk</i> menu opens it
on the screen. The third method is to double-click the mouse button
while the cursor is on top of that document&rsquo;s icon. (&ldquo;Double-clicking&rdquo;
means to press the mouse button twice in quick succession.)
</p><p>
We have just seen the first instance of an action &ndash; double-clicking &ndash; that 
has different results in different contexts. When you double-click on a stationery 
pad, you tear off a piece of paper from this pad. When you double-click on an 
ordinary piece of paper, it opens to a window. Because most of us normally operate 
in such a context-dependent manner, Lisa mimics this, making Lisa all the more 
natural to use.

<b>Window components.</b> The components of a document window vary with the type of 
paper being used, but all Lisa windows have some similarity. <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig34'>Figure 3-4</a> shows 
a theoretical composite window that contains all the features of all types of 
windows. No such window actually exists on Lisa; it appears here only for 
explanatory purposes.
</p><p>
At the top of the window is its title bar, containing the document name as 
well as a mini-icon representing the Lisa program that &ldquo;owns&rdquo; this 
document. This icon can be used to remove a document from the screen by 
double-clicking the mouse while the cursor is on top of the mini-icon. (Another 
way is to use one of the commands of the <i>File/Print</i> menu, as will 
be explained shortly.)
</p><p>
<b>Moving the window through a document.</b> On the right edge of the window 
are two <b>vertical scroll arrows,</b> two <b>vertical view buttons,</b> 
an <b>elevator;</b> and a <b>horizontal split control bar.</b> Let&rsquo;s take 
these one at a time.
<br clear=all></p><p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100% class=list><tr><td width=16><img width=16 height=9 src='intr/liststart.png'></td></tr><tr><td width=16 background='intr/listfill.png' valign=top><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=16 height=15 src='intr/listbullet.png'></td><td width=100%><table width=100% class=list cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign=top width=5 valign=middle><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=5 height=15 src='intr/listbulletfill.png'></td><td class=content width=100%><table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><img class=screenshotborderless src='pics/books/thecompletebookoflisa/scrollarrows.jpg'></td></tr></table>
The <b>vertical scroll arrows</b> &ndash; the top one pointing up and 
the bottom one pointing down &ndash; enable you to shift the window one unit 
up or down. (The actual size of a unit depends on the type of document being 
viewed. In a <i>LisaWrite</i> document, one unit equals approximately one line of 
text; in a <i>LisaCalc</i> document, one unit equals one spreadsheet row.) Because 
the window moves in relation to the document, shifting the window up one 
unit reveals the unit of information just above the top edge of the window 
and shifts all the units inside the window down one position; the unit at 
the bottom disappears from the window. To initiate this movement, click the 
mouse button while the cursor is on top of the appropriate scroll arrow. 
If you want to scroll more than one unit, simply continue to hold the button down.
</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td width=16 background='intr/listfill.png' valign=top><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=16 height=15 src='intr/listbullet.png'></td><td width=100%><table width=100% class=list cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign=top width=5 valign=middle><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=5 height=15 src='intr/listbulletfill.png'></td><td class=content width=100%><table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><img class=screenshotborderless src='pics/books/thecompletebookoflisa/viewbuttons.jpg'></td></tr></table>
The two <b>vertical view buttons</b> allow you to move the window up or down 
the length of one entire window to provide an entirely new window of 
information. The shape of the view buttons is intended to suggest flipping 
pages &ndash; they show the left-hand corner of a page being turned up 
or down. The view buttons are activated in the same manner as the scroll arrows;
by clicking the mouse button while the cursor is on top of the desired view 
button. 
</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td width=16 background='intr/listfill.png' valign=top><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=16 height=15 src='intr/listbullet.png'></td><td width=100%><table width=100% class=list cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign=top width=5 valign=middle><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=5 height=15 src='intr/listbulletfill.png'></td><td class=content width=100%><table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><img class=screenshotborderless src='pics/books/thecompletebookoflisa/elevator.jpg'></td></tr></table>
The <b>elevator</b> is a white square that is always positioned in the 
narrow, gray column at the extreme right of the window (sometimes called 
the &ldquo;elevator shaft&rdquo;). The elevator&rsquo;s position in this column 
reflects the position of the window in a document. If the window is near 
the beginning of a document, the elevator is near the top of the shaft. If 
the window is near the end of a document, the elevator is near the bottom. 
Using either the scroll arrows or the view buttons causes the elevator to 
change position.
</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><img width=16 height=8 src='intr/listend.png'></td></tr></table></p><p>
Not only does the elevator indirectly reflect the position of the window in 
the document, it also can be used directly to position the window. The elevator 
allows you to move the window over great distances in a document with a 
single action. To do this, press the mouse button while the cursor is on top 
of the elevator. While the button is held, the elevator may be moved up 
and down in the elevator shaft by moving the mouse in the appropriate 
direction. When you release the button, the window jumps to the corresponding 
position in the document. Although this type of window positioning is not 
extremely accurate (it is difficult to move a window to exactly the same 
position every time), it allows you to move large distances quickly &ndash; from 
the beginning of the document to the end, for example &ndash; in one simple 
step. Note that when you are at the end of a document, the elevator never quite 
reaches the bottom of the shaft. Don&rsquo;t be concerned; this 
is one of Lisa&rsquo;s little quirks.
</p><p>
Most Lisa programs use a &ldquo;current insertion&rdquo; position &ndash; marked 
by a blinking vertical bar &ndash; where, for example, text entered from the 
keyboard will appear. Often, after using the window-positioning controls, the 
current insertion position will not appear in the window. Pushing the Enter 
key will reposition the window so that this insertion position is inside the 
window. The Enter key is used in this manner for all Lisa programs, although 
it is not mentioned in any of the manuals.

Each portion may be scrolled independently.</td></tr></table>
The <b>horizontal split control bar</b> is located near the top of the right side of 
the window. This enables the window to be divided horizontally into two 
separate windows within the same document. This can be extremely useful when 
you&rsquo;re working simultaneously with two widely separated portions of 
a single document &ndash; preparing an index or table of contents, for example. 
To use this window-splitting feature, position the cursor on top of the horizontal split 
control bar and press the mouse button. Holding the button, move the split 
control bar down, adjusting the window size in the top and bottom sections. 
While the button remains pressed, these proportions may be adjusted 
continuously. You&rsquo;ll see a gray horizontal line the entire width of the 
window, moving up and down in response your cursor movements. Once the button 
is released, the proportions are fixed. <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig35'>Figure 3-5</a> shows a <i>LisaWrite</i>
window split horizontally into two roughly equal sub-windows. Note that each 
sub-window has its own set of view buttons, scroll arrows, and elevator. 
Each sub-window can be independently positioned using these devices. Note, too, 
that each sub-window has its own horizontal split control bar. The 
horizontal-split-control bar of the top sub-window is used to split that 
sub-window into even smaller parts.
</p><p>
Any lower split control bars are used to readjust the proportions between the two 
sub-windows it divides. You can split a window into many sub-windows; the 
limit of usefulness of sub-windows is reached long before any Lisa-imposed limit.
</p><p>
The bottom of <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig34'>Figure 3-4</a> contains two horizontal scroll arrows, two 
horizontal view buttons, a vertical split control bar, and a horizontal 
elevator. Each works exactly like its counterpart on the right edge of 
the window, except that horizontal movement replaces vertical, or vice versa.

Multiple windows
</p><p>
As you now can see, you can have a variety of windows, each adjusted to a 
different size. Moreover, each can be moved about the screen, and they may 
even overlap each other. To open several windows, simply open the first using 
any of the procedures outlined above (the <b>Open</b> command on the <i>File/Print</i>
menu, the <i>Desk</i> menu, or by double-clicking the mouse); then repeat 
the procedure to open subsequent windows.
</p><p>

The use of multiple windows sometimes appears confusing or difficult, especially when 
those screens are viewed statically (as in <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig36'>Figure 3-6</a>). When you actively 
construct your own multiple windows, however, multiple overlaps really are natural 
to use and easy to understand.
</p><p>
<b>Changing window size.</b> At the bottom right-hand corner of the composite 
window in <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig34'>Figure 3-4</a> is a size control box. This is used to change the size 
of a window. To do this, press the mouse button while the cursor is inside this 
box. As you keep the button pressed, you can adjust the window size by 
moving the mouse horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
</p><p>
You can change the window size in one of three ways:
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100% class=list><tr><td width=16><img width=16 height=9 src='intr/liststart.png'></td></tr><tr><td width=16 background='intr/listfill.png' valign=top><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=16 height=15 src='intr/listbullet.png'></td><td width=100%><table width=100% class=list cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td valign=top width=5 valign=middle><img style='margin-top: 0.5em' width=5 height=15 src='intr/listbulletfill.png'></td><td class=content width=100%>Moving the mouse horizontally makes the window wider or narrower.

</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><img width=16 height=8 src='intr/listend.png'></td></tr></table></p><p>
As you adjust the window size, a gray-lined window border moves up and 
down and back and forth in response to the cursor movements. When the mouse 
button is released, the window size becomes fixed, at least until the next 
time the size control box is used. This size adjustment does not alter 
the relative position of the window or underlying document. You are reminded of 
this fact by the shape of the size control box, which shows a small rectangle 
being enlarged into a bigger rectangle, both of which share the upper 
left-hand corner.

<b>Changing window position.</b> The position of the window on the
desktop (as opposed to its position within a document) can be changed with 
ease. To move the window, press the mouse button while the cursor is on 
top of the window&rsquo;s title bar. Keeping the mouse button depressed, 
use the mouse to move the window around the screen. During this operation, the 
outline of the new window position appears on the screen in response to 
the cursor&rsquo;s movements. When the button is released, the actual window moves 
to fill the outline. The window even can be moved partly off the 
screen (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig37'>Figure 3-7</a>).
</p><p>
<b>The active window.</b> Each Lisa program has menus and commands not used 
in other programs. <i>LisaDraw,</i> for example, has a Lines menu for setting 
line thickness. Such a menu would be inappropriate in <i>LisaWrite,</i> 
or most other Lisa programs. Accordingly, Lisa&rsquo;s desktop displays the 
appropriate set of menus in the menu title bar based on the program 
currently in use. So, if two windows are on the screen, each from a 
different program using different menus, which set of menu titles would 
appear? Lisa&rsquo;s solution is to display menu titles appropriate for the 
window in which you&rsquo;re currently working &ndash; the &ldquo;active&rdquo; 
window. The active window is distinguished from the other, inactive, windows 
by several characteristics:

other inactive windows.)
</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><img width=16 height=8 src='intr/listend.png'></td></tr></table></p><p>
There is at most one active window on Lisa&rsquo;s desktop at any particular 
moment. It is possible, however, to have several windows on the screen, with 
none of them active. This situation could arise if, for example, you decided 
to copy a micro diskette, tear off a piece of <i>LisaProject</i> paper 
from <i>LisaProject</i> stationery, or perform some other desktop operation. 
To do such operations, you must select an icon on the screen. This icon 
selection turns the active window inactive.
</p><p>
To activate any inactive window, click the mouse button while the cursor 
is anywhere inside the window to be activated. This simple action has the 
following consequences:

Menus
</p><p>
On most personal computers, you must remember the names of commands and must 
actually enter them on the keyboard. This presents system designers with a 
difficult decision: to make the command names long and descriptive of what they 
do, but time-consuming to enter, or to make the names short and easy to type, 
but difficult to remember, or even recognize. Lisa&rsquo;s designers neatly 
sidestepped this problem by designing an entirely new method for entering 
commands, a method that uses long and descriptive command names but which requires 
less effort and time to enter.
</p><p>
The method involves Lisa&rsquo;s menus. Much like a restaurant menu, a 
computer menu is a list of choices. But a computer menu is a list of 
command names, each serving a different function. Consider the task of
printing a document, for example. On a computer system, such a task could 
require entering any of a variety of commands, including PRINT, TYPE, LIST, 
OUTPUT, P, PR, or OPR. On Lisa, however, you are presented with the following menu:
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=left class=screenshotmarginleft><tr><td align=left><img class=screenshotborderless src='pics/books/thecompletebookoflisa/menu.jpg'></td></tr></table>
<br clear=all>
</p><p>
It isn&rsquo;t difficult to conclude that, to print a document, the correct choice 
is <b>Print...</b>. Even if you have a variety of computers that must be 
used regularly (and a variety of command names that must be remembered to print 
a document), you&rsquo;ll never forget the print command used on Lisa.
</p><p>
Although no one disputes the advantages of menus, they do have one serious 
disadvantage: They take up space on the screen. Depending on the size of 
the menu, it may require as much as ten to fifteen percent of screen space. Space 
is always at a premium on Lisa&rsquo;s desktop (just like on your own desk). No 
matter how much space there is, it always seems that more is needed. Lisa 
overcomes this disadvantage by using a special technique previously available only 
on the most expensive computers &ndash; menus that appear when you need them 
and then disappear.
</p><p>
Menus of this type come in two varieties, &ldquo;pop-up&rdquo; menus 
and &ldquo;pull-down&rdquo; menus. Pop-up menus appear at different places 
on the screen, depending on a variety of factors. Pull-down menus always appear 
on the screen at the same location. They get their name from the fact that 
when the menu is displayed, it appears similar to a pull-down window 
shade, unfolding from the top of the screen.
</p><p>
Lisa uses pull-down menus when you must specify command names. The available 
menu titles are always displayed across the top of the screen in the 
<b>menu title bar.</b> To pull one down, you need only press the mouse button 
while the cursor is on top of a menu title. The menu instantaneously appears beneath 
its title, temporarily obscuring a portion of the screen. The menu remains 
on the screen as long as the mouse button is pressed. This procedure is 
independent of the number of windows on the screen, their positions on the 
screen, and the types of programs in use &ndash; another example of Lisa&rsquo;s 
uniform user interface.
</p><p>

Menu display on Lisa is not used just to remind you of the correct names 
of commands. The menu also is used to enter commands &ndash; or, in Lisa&rsquo;s 
jargon, for &ldquo;command activation.&rdquo; While the menu is displayed, you 
must continue to press the mouse button. Moving the mouse (while holding 
the button) so the cursor lies on top of a command causes that command 
to appear in reverse video. When the button is released, that command 
becomes activated, the menu disappears, and the screen reverts to its original 
appearance. If the button is released with none of the command names 
highlighted, as would happed if the cursor were positioned in some part 
of the screen other than the menu, no command is activated, but the menu 
still disappears and the screen reverts to its original appearance.
</p><p>
On Lisa, menus are not merely unstructured lists of command names; commands 
in each menu have been carefully arranged and grouped to help you avoid 
errors. <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig38'>Figure 3-8</a>, the Edit menu of <i>LisaDraw,</i> shows this 
substructure. The commands are grouped to make the menu less visually 
imposing. (A menu of fourteen single commands is harder to
use than a menu of fourteen commands divided into six logical groupings.) Moreover, 
commands inappropriate for the current selection are deactivated, appearing as gray 
text on a white background. Gray commands cannot be activated from 
the menu.
</p><p>
Commands followed by an ellipsis (&ldquo;...&rdquo;) require additional settings before 
they may be executed. Activating such commands results in the display of 
a <b>Dialog Box</b> &ndash; for example, the Comfort Dialog Box used 
in <i>LisaTerminal</i> (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig39'>Figure 3-9</a>). To complete these commands, you 
must check the appropriate options, then click the mouse button on the box&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;OK&rdquo; button.

These are displayed automatically when Lisa needs additional information to complete a command.</td></tr></table>
Commands followed by the Apple symbol and a letter can be activated without using a 
menu at all. The Apple symbol plus the letter &ldquo;X&rdquo; following the <b>Cut</b>
command, for example, means that instead of executing this command via the 
pull-down menu, you may simply type an &ldquo;X&rdquo; while simultaneously pressing the 
Apple key to the left of the Space Bar on the keyboard. Such menu items followed 
by Apple key commands are available for the most frequently used commands, to make 
them convenient. (I almost never use this method, however. Command activation via 
the menu is fast enough, and the Apple key commands are hard to remember. I would 
need to pull down the menu just to recall the abbreviation. By the time I did 
that, I could have simply activated the command directly from the menu.)
</p><p>
After you have several months of experience on Lisa, the phenomenon of &ldquo;muscle 
memory&rdquo; begins to take over &ndash; the unconscious ability to remember 
the position of individual commands on the various menus, enabling you 
to pull down a menu and activate a command in one step. The muscles of your 
hand &ldquo;remember&rdquo; how far down to move the mouse to highlight the desired 
command, even though you, if questioned, probably can&rsquo;t consciously recall even 
the order of the commands. This muscle memory is partly responsible for the 
speed with which menu-selected commands can be activated by an experienced user. 
The importance of muscle memory is strengthened by Apple&rsquo;s commitment never 
to rearrange command names on any menus. New commands may be appended 
to the ends of the menus, but they are never added in the middle.
</p><p class=caption>
Alert messages
</p><p>
On most computers, if you somehow stray from the precise steps needed to interact 
with the machine, this is treated as a &ldquo;user error.&rdquo; In other words, 
you are treated as subordinate to the machine, which is dictating the 
communication. Even more demeaning, user errors often prompt the computer to 
react with the most terse and threatening of messages:
</p><p align=center>
<i>WHAT?<br>
ERROR IEH4735<br>
JOB ABORTED<br>
FATAL ERROR 802<br>
DISASTROUS STRING OVERFLOW &ndash; JOB ABANDONED<br>
CATASTROPHIC ERROR; LOGGED WITH OPERATOR<br>
ILLEGAL ENTRY &ndash; USER SESSION TERMINATED</i>
</p><p>
Someone once conjectured what it might be like if such messages appeared when you 
dialed a wrong telephone number. Instead of the usual message (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re 
sorry, we were unable to complete your call as dialed. Please hang up, check your 
number, or consult the operator for assistance.&rdquo;), you might get 
something like this:
</p><p align=center>
<i>ILLEGAL PHONE NUMBER. CALL ABORTED.<br>
ERROR 583-2R6.9. <br>
CONSULT MANUAL FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.</i>
</p><p>
Lisa&rsquo;s designers took an entirely different approach. In their view, there 
are no errors, merely breakdowns in the user-machine dialog &ndash; breakdowns 
caused by an inadequacy of the machine to respond to the user&rsquo;s intentions. 
Accordingly, there are no user errors in Lisa. The term &ldquo;errors,&rdquo; in 
fact, is reserved for internal Lisa failures &ndash; running out of memory, for 
example, or a power failure. Lisa does notify you that some command or recent input 
was not possible as you specified, but in a much more pleasant and useful way. 
This notification takes place in an <b>Alert Box,</b> an area of the upper portion 
of the screen that temporarily overlays everything but the cursor.
</p><p>
There are five different Alert Boxes, each represented by a different shape:

Common menus
</p><p>
Although most menus associated with Lisa programs are unique to those programs, three 
menus are common to all: the <i>Desk</i> menu, the <i>File/Print</i> menu, and 
the basic commands of the <i>Edit</i> menu. Because of this commonality, a brief 
explanation will be given here. The minor differences in the specifics of 
these menus for some individual programs, if any, will be discussed in the 
chapters devoted to those programs.

<b>The Desk menu.</b> The <i>Desk</i> menu enables you to open any icon on 
the desktop or to tear off any piece of stationery without having to touch 
the icon directly with the cursor. Every icon currently on the desktop will 
be listed in the <i>Desk</i> menu when it is pulled down, so the exact menu will 
vary from Lisa to Lisa and even from time to time on the same Lisa. My Lisa&rsquo;s 
<i>Desk</i> menu is shown in <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig311'>Figure 3-11</a>. The most important use of
the <i>Desk</i> menu is to provide you with a means of opening up another icon 
while your screen is covered with some other work. Without this menu, you would have 
to re-size or move many windows, perhaps even close some windows to locate icons.

<b>The File/Print menu.</b> The typical <i>File/Print</i> menu (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig312'>Figure 3-12</a>) 
lets you control the storage, retrieval, and printing of the current document. 
These commands are grouped into three sets:

</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><img width=16 height=8 src='intr/listend.png'></td></tr></table></p><p>
The first command of the first set, <b>Set Aside Everything,</b> closes all 
open windows and places an icon bearing the documents&rsquo; names on the 
The command <b>Set Aside (document name)</b> closes the open window to the 
document named and places that document&rsquo;s icon on the desktop.
</p><p>
Whenever any open window on the desktop is selected (that is, when its scroll 
bars are visible and its name in the title bar is highlighted in reverse 
video), the <b>Set Aside (document name)</b> command displays the name of that 
document in the <i>File/Print</i> menu in place of (document name). Lisa &ldquo;knows&rdquo; 
you are currently manipulating that document and thus customizes the menu.
</p><p>
This customization often surprises new Lisa users, even those experienced with other 
systems. On most systems, you must manipulate files through use of a special 
command language that is directly executed by the machine&rsquo;s operating 
system. (The operating system is the most basic program on the machine. All other 
programs are invoked through the use of the operating system.) As surprising as 
this may seem, that operating system typically does not appear to &ldquo;know&rdquo; 
what you are doing when an application program such as word processing or 
spreadsheets is being used. Because Lisa is highly integrated your job is 
that much easier. One result of all this magic: Commands in the pull-down 
menus become customized, and other commands that don&rsquo;t apply to the 
current selection are deactivated.
</p><p>
This set of commands in the <i>File/Print</i> menu &ndash; <b>Set Aside 
Everything</b> and <b>Set Aside (document name)</b> &ndash; is appropriate when 
a document being closed will probably be opened again shortly. This command does 
not, however, affect the copy of the document stored on disk (either the 
Winchester, Profile, or a micro diskette). So, a power failure would 
result in a loss of some work, but you&rsquo;d still have a copy stored on disk. 
It is for precisely this situation &ndash; the unexpected loss of power or some 
other calamity &ndash; that the next set of commands in the <i>File/Print</i> 
menu is designed.
</p><p>
Two of the commands in the next set, <b>Save and Put Away</b> and <b>Save 
and Continue,</b> modify the stored copy, preventing loss of work in the 
event of a calamity. These commands differ only in what happens after the copy is stored.
</p><p>
<b>Save and Put Away</b> closes the window and returns the document to 
its disk storage location. <b>Save and Continue</b> leaves the window open and allows 
you to continue working after storing the modified copy. Because these commands 
are similar, they will collectively be referred to as the <b>Save</b> commands when 
both would have the same effect.
</p><p>
If you make a catastrophic mistake on your own, the third command of this set, 
<b>Revert to Previous Version,</b> provides you with a recovery option. Suppose, 
for example, after deleting several lengthy paragraphs and adding a new 
sentence or two to a <i>LisaWrite</i> document, you determine this wasn&rsquo;t 
what you really had in mind. You can activate <b>Revert to Previous Version,</b> 
and everything will be restored to the state that existed before these changes were 
made. Whenever you execute this command, you are returned to the state 
of the document after the last <b>Save</b> command.
</p><p>
The <b>Save</b> commands should be executed frequently, albeit with some caution, 
so that in the event of a major mistake or malfunction, you won&rsquo;t wipe out 
hours of productive work. Because when you save you also wipe out the previous 
version of the document, however, the <b>Save</b> commands should be executed 
with some caution; there is no way to retrieve an earlier version once you 
have saved a subsequent version. It would be unwise, then, to attempt some 
far-reaching command &ndash; a global search and replace, for example &ndash; 
and immediately <b>Save</b> the document, just in case the first command 
was incorrectly applied.
</p><p>
The last set of commands in the <i>File/Print</i> menu enables you to specify 
the printing characteristics of a document, to print the document, and to 
monitor the status of the printer. To understand the first command in this 
set, <b>Print As Is,</b> you need to know about all the other printing commands, 
so the <b>Print As Is</b> discussion will be deferred for a moment.
</p><p>
The second command in this last <i>File/Print</i> set, <b>Format for Printer...,</b> 
provides you with a method to specify the manner in which a document will 
eventually be printed. It is important to specify this information using 
<b>Format for Printer...</b> before a great deal of text is entered into the document.
</p><p>
It may seem strange to tell Lisa how and on which type of printer a 
document will be printed before the document is even begun. But there are 
two distinct reasons why this is necessary. First, it is important for Lisa to 
know what size paper will be used &ndash; letter size (8&frac12;&times;11&rdquo;), legal 
size (8&frac12;&rdquo;&times;14&rdquo;), or computer 
size (11&rdquo;&times;14&rdquo;) &ndash; and in what orientation the paper will 
be so the screen can reflect the printed version exactly.
</p><p>
Second, Lisa uses several different types of printers: some dot-matrix printers and 
a daisy wheel printer. Their capabilities are not equal. If you inform Lisa that 
the document on which you are now working is to be printed on one type of printer 
and later try to enter a type face or size not available on that device, you will 
be so informed and advised to change either the type style or the printer. (More on 
fonts, faces, and type sizes in Chapter Four.)
</p><p>
<table width=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=right class=screenshotmargin><tr><td align=left><a href='http://guidebookgallery.org/books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig313'><img class=screenshotborderless alt='Figure 3-13: The Format for Printer...

When <b>Format for Printer...</b> is activated, you are presented with a Dialog 
Box and asked to select from a variety of options. The operation is quite 
similar to checking options on a printed form with a pencil, although there 
are some key differences. Using the mouse, you check small boxes (the cursor shape 
even changes into a small check mark). Note, however, that a choice made in 
one part of the Dialog Box may affect everthing else in the box, even the 
number of other possible choices and the type of information requested.
</p><p>
Lisa &ldquo;knows&rdquo; what type of printer you have connected to it. (Exactly 
how it &ldquo;knows&rdquo; is discussed in Chapter Twelve.) If you have an ImageWriter 
(or the older dot-matrix printer) connected, you will see the Dialog Box shown 
in <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig313'>Figure 3-13</a> when you activate <b>Format for Printer...</b>. If you 
have a daisy wheel printer, you will see another Dialog
Box (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig314'>Figure 3-14</a>), and so on for all the printers that work with Lisa. 
If you have more than one type of printer connected to Lisa, you will be asked 
to specify which printer you want to use.
</p><p>
This last choice is extremely important because the print wheel determines the 
type style and size of the characters you may print and, therefore, the 
characters Lisa will be able to print. Special characters, like the Japanese yen 
sign or the German diacritical umlaut, simply don&rsquo;t appear on every print 
wheel. If you use such characters, you&rsquo;ll have to find a print wheel 
that contains them. The dot-matrix printers (ImageWriter, dot-matrix, ink-jet) have 
no type-style restrictions at all and are, therefore, more versatile.
</p><p>

There&rsquo;s a very frustrating bug in this process, however. If you have one 
of these special characters in your document and are using a daisy wheel 
printer, Lisa doesn&rsquo;t tell you in advance that the characters are 
unavailable. You find out because Lisa instructs the printer to print an 
upside-down question mark in place of the desired character. You must 
proofread your document to find these marks, then take proper action to 
remedy them. Previous versions of Lisa software warned you in advance of such 
problems; this bug wasn&rsquo;t created until the updated programs were 
released. (Proofreading cannot be overstressed, by the way. Even Apple 
Corporation, Lisa&rsquo;s creators, apparently fall victim to this. Several 
documents they&rsquo;ve distributed to the press and to third-party 
programmers have contained upside-down question marks on several pages. Perhaps this 
will motivate Apple to find a more suitable solution to this problem in 
future software releases.)

The next command, <b>Print...</b>, puts to use the information you stored in 
<b>Format for Printer...</b>. With <b>Print...</b>, you initiate printing the 
active document. Again, you have a variety of options (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig315'>Figure 3-15</a>). You can
select either high quality for final versions or lower quality for speedy 
drafts. (However, the quick draft mode, though it specifies &ldquo;text only,&rdquo; 
cannot print all the characters available on Lisa, even when using the 
dot-matrix printer. What quick draft really uses is the character set
already stored in the printer &ndash; the characters on the daisy wheel for 
the daisy wheel printer or those stored in the character memory for the dot-matrix 
printers. Neither character set includes every available character. Thus, if you 
frequently use the symbol for British pounds (&pound;) or any other unusual 
characters, you should stay away from the quick draft printing option.)
</p><p>
In addition to specifying print quality and priority, the <b>Print...</b> Dialog 
Box lets you determine a page range for the printing and the number of copies 
of the document you want to print.
</p><p>
The last command in the <i>File/Print</i> menu is <b>Monitor the Printer...</b> This 
is used to check on a printing request. When a low-priority printing process 
encounters an error, such as the printer being turned off or running out 
of paper, Lisa generates a special attention tone. (Lisa&rsquo;s developers call 
it the &ldquo;joyful noise.&rdquo;) It is then up to you to execute 
<b>Monitor the Printer...</b> to determine the problem. You can ignore the tone 
and finish whatever you&rsquo;re doing, but the printer will not start again until 
<b>Monitor the Printer...</b> is executed and you take whatever action is 
necessary. Often, the tone merely indicates that you need to position the 
next piece of paper properly in the printer.
</p><p>
<b>Monitor the Printer...</b> also lets you see how many documents are 
waiting to print. On Lisa, you can request the printing of additional documents 
before the document currently printing is completed. Lisa places a 
copy of the document in the system area of the hard disk and
allows you to continue to work. The only thing to be concerned about is that 
this system area becomes too full. Knowing how many documents are waiting to print 
gives you a crude measure of the space being taken up.
</p><p>
The <b>Print As Is</b> command we skipped over earlier allows you to print 
one copy of the entire document with the currently set format without having to 
fill out the <b>Print...</b> Dialog Box. It is a kind of quick print command.
</p><p>
With the single exception of the <b>Print...</b> command, there is little 
involved in executing any of the commands of the <i>File/Print</i> menu that is 
not immediately clear from a simple definition of what each command does. The 
only additional guidance about the <b>Print...</b> command is that it takes a 
long time to print documents on the various Lisa printers. It can take as 
long as ninety minutes to print a twenty-page document with high resolution on 
the older Dot Matrix Printer. (Apple is rumored to have a much faster 
laser printer under development. Such a device would produce a twenty-page 
document in less than three minutes and at a much higher quality. This device, 
however, will probably be expensive and practical only in an environment where it 
can be shared among a number of Lisas or Macintoshes.)

<b>The Edit menu.</b> The last menu all Lisa programs have in common is the 
<i>Edit</i> menu (<a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig316'>Figure 3-16</a>). Like the <i>File/Print</i> menu, this 
menu&rsquo;s commands come in three sets, two of which contain a single command 
each. The first command, <b>Undo Last Change,</b> is one talked about by almost anyone 
interested in making computers less threatening and easier to use. Unfortunately, 
it is available on very few computers. Simply put, <b>Undo Last Change</b> lets 
you reverse the effects of almost any other command. Suppose, for example, you 
make a mistake that significantly alters a document on which you are working. All 
you need to do to recover is to execute <b>Undo Last Change.</b>
</p><p>
Such a command is not just for novices. Even experts make mistakes that can 
be very time-consuming to recover from manually. This command is more important 
even than the work it saves from time to time. The mere presence of an <b>Undo</b>
command probably lowers the number of mistakes you make. The tension present from 
knowing that an entire day&rsquo;s work could be instantly destroyed may cause 
you to make blunders. Having an <b>Undo</b> command removes that tension and makes 
your experience with Lisa more productive and enjoyable.
</p><p>
For any user, <b>Undo Last Change</b> makes experimenting possible. Although Lisa 
is both easy to learn and use, it is a large system. To learn everything on the 
system well may take several months of intensive study. Knowing you can undo 
something may make you more willing to try new commands, or old commands in 
unusual ways. The more commands you use and the more ways in which you are able 
to use them, the more productive your use of Lisa will become. Unfortunately, 
for a variety of technical reasons, it isn&rsquo;t possible to have 
<b>Undo Last Change</b> work for every action you take. Those few that don&rsquo;t 
allow an &ldquo;undo&rdquo; (<b>Revert to Previous Version,</b> for example) usually 
warn you with an Alert Box before processing.
</p><p>
The next set of <i>Edit</i> commands provides you with the ability to move 
portions of text, figures, spreadsheets, lists, and other items around within 
a document, between different documents of the same type (two <i>LisaDraw</i> 
documents, for example), or even between documents written by different Lisa 
programs. The three commands in this set all make use of the clipboard 
icon, the temporary storage place shared by all Lisa programs. Two of these 
commands, <b>Cut</b> and <b>Copy,</b> put material on the clipboard. The third, 
<b>Paste,</b> copies it from the clipboard and into the active document.
</p><p>
The difference between <b>Cut</b> and <b>Copy</b> is that <b>Cut</b> removes the 
current selection from the document and places it on the clipboard, while 
<b>Copy</b> places it on the clipboard without removing it from the document. <b>Paste</b>
inserts the current contents of the clipboard into the active document. Exactly 
how and where these contents are added to the current document depends on the 
type of document; this is discussed in greater detail in the individual chapters 
on those programs. This slight complication isn&rsquo;t a deficiency; rather, it 
reflects the various possibilities in different types of Lisa documents. In 
a <i>LisaDraw</i> document, for example, it makes sense to paste material right on 
top of the current drawing. This doesn&rsquo;t make sense for <i>LisaWrite.</i> 
Regardless of what is done, <b>Paste</b> doesn&rsquo;t remove material from the 
clipboard. This means you can do multiple pastes to put several copies of the 
clipboard&rsquo;s contents into a document.
</p><p>
The final set of <i>Edit</i> commands contains the single command, <b>Select 
All of Document.</b> This is used rather frequently and is extremely useful when 
everything in a document must be changed or reformatted. Activating this command 
selects everything in the document and makes it the object of the next 
command. Surprisingly, this command does not take a long time to execute, even 
when the document is large. To select all of a fifty-page <i>LisaWrite</i> 
document, for example, takes only 1.5 seconds.
