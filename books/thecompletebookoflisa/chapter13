Using <i>LisaTerminal,</i> Lisa can emulate several types of standard computer 
terminals, enabling you to take advantage of the tremendous amount of software 
written for these terminals. What this does primarily is connect you to 
software of the past. <i>MacWorks,</i> the Macintosh emulator for Lisa, provides 
you with a connection to the software of the present and the future.
</p><p>
Just as <i>LisaTerminal</i> enables Lisa to pretend it is one of several computer 
terminals, <i>MacWorks</i> enables Lisa to pretend it is a Macintosh, the junior 
member of the Apple computer family with Lisa-like capabilities. The similarity 
between <i>LisaTerminal</i> and <i>MacWorks</i> ends, however, at this rather 
simple description. Emulating a simple terminal is one thing; it involves 
responding correctly to a few dozen control codes of a particular terminal with 
its very limited amounts of memory and minimal processing power. Even 
emulating several such terminals really is no major accomplishment. Emulating 
Macintosh, however, requires simulating all Macintosh internal programs and 
hardware interfaces, and doing this fast enough so that you are unaware 
that you aren&rsquo;t actually using a Macintosh.
</p><p>
Technically speaking, <i>MacWorks</i> loads into Lisa&rsquo;s RAM (random-access 
memory &ndash; a full 1,000K on Lisa) the programs that are part of the 
Macintosh&rsquo;s ROM (read-only memory &ndash; memory permanently built into Macintosh). 
Considering that Macintosh has 64K of ROM (compared to the 2K or 3K in 
most personal computers), loading this into Lisa&rsquo;s 1,000K RAM would seem to be 
a trivial task. It isn&rsquo;t. For a long time, the type of emulation that 
<i>MacWorks</i> represents was thought to be impossible. A long technical 
struggle was necessary to prove that it is possible. An equally long 
struggle was necessary to make the emulation perform at the speed expected 
of Macintosh and Lisa.
</p><p class=caption>
Using MacWorks
</p><p>
<i>MacWorks</i> cannot execute simultaneously with Lisa&rsquo;s <i>Office System.</i> 
Unlike <i>LisaTerminal,</i> in which Lisa can emulate another device inside 
of a window, <i>MacWorks</i> takes over the Lisa hardware. To use it you 
must boot Lisa from the <i>MacWorks</i> diskette. To do so, you perform the 
following procedure:

if you want to, because access to them will not be necessary. (Details about the

appear elsewhere in this chapter.)

After about 30 seconds, the 
<i>MacWorks</i> diskette will be ejected and a single diskette icon will appear 
on the screen. This icon will have a large &ldquo;X&rdquo; through it. Even though 
this gives every impression of being an error message (which it is, under 
other circumstances), everything is fine. <i>MacWorks</i> is now loaded. You now 
need only insert a diskette containing any Macintosh software package. Your 
&ldquo;Macintosh&rdquo; will then complete booting correctly.

You can now use any Macintosh software. Or, more precisely, <i>almost</i> any 
Macintosh software, for there are some differences between running <i>MacWorks</i> and 
running an actual Macintosh.

There are only a few key differences between a Lisa running <i>MacWorks</i> 
and Macintosh itself. These differences are caused by the few underlying hardware 
differences between Lisa and Macintosh &ndash; differences no emulation program could 
ever overcome. Those include the size of the screen, the presence of a 
sound generator on Macintosh, the larger amount of memory on Lisa, the speed 
differences in the two computers&rsquo; processors, and the devices that can 
be interfaced to each system. With the exception of the differences in screen size, 
most differences are rarely noticed.
</p><p>
<b>Screen size.</b> In technical terms, Macintosh has a total of 175,104 dots 
on its 9&rdquo; screen (342 rows of 512 dots each) &ndash; each of which can 
be made to appear either white or black. Lisa, however, has a total of 
262,080 dots on its 12&rdquo; screen (364 rows of 720 dots each) &ndash; again, 
either white or black. In simpler terms, Lisa&rsquo;s screen simply is bigger 
than Macintosh&rsquo;s screen.
</p><p>
When determining how to make Lisa emulate Macintosh, Apple designers had two basic 
alternatives to resolving this difference. The first was to use only the first 
512 dots on the first 342 lines of Lisa&rsquo;s screen when running the 
emulation. This would leave the bottom and right portions of the screen 
dark. The second alternative was to use the whole Lisa screen, making it 
appear to be a &ldquo;big-screen&rdquo; Macintosh when using <i>MacWorks</i> 
software. Fortunately, Apple chose the second alternative. This means that you 
have more room on the <i>MacWorks</i> screen than you do with a real Macintosh. 
Most of the time, you can take full advantage of this extra space, as 
Figures <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig131'>13-1</a> and <a href='books/thecompletebookoflisa/pics/fig132'>13-2</a> show. This
difference is most appreciated when you have several windows open on the screen. 
In some cases, however, Macintosh software won&rsquo;t let you make full use 
of the big screen. These cases usually involve single-window programs such 
as <i>MacWrite</i> (Macintosh&rsquo;s word processing package), <i>MacPaint,</i> 
and <i>MacDraw</i> (both are graphics packages for Macintosh). These programs 
simply won&rsquo;t allow you to make a window bigger than the Macintosh screen.
</p><p>

In addition to having more usable dots, Lisa&rsquo;s screen has a different 
aspect ratio &ndash; that is, a different ratio of height to width &ndash; from 
that of the Macintosh screen. The result is that images on MacWorks Lisa are 
slightly elongated in a vertical direction. While this is noticeable, such 
distortion isn&rsquo;t unacceptable.
</p><p>
<b>Sound generator.</b> Macintosh comes with a very impressive sound generator. 
Lisa has no such hardware. Macintosh software that uses this sound generator 
won&rsquo;t produce the correct sounds when run under MacWorks on Lisa.
</p><p>
<b>Memory differences.</b> Lisa has a little more than five times more
memory than Macintosh (1,000K on Lisa vs. 192K on Macintosh). For some tasks, 
this memory difference can make a Lisa running <i>MacWorks</i> actually 
faster than the Macintosh itself. One example is copying a disk. Since 
Macintosh has only one disk drive, a disk-to-disk copy works by copying a 
portion of the disk into memory; then you must take out the first disk and 
put in the second. The portion of the first disk now in memory is then 
written onto the second disk. You must then switch back to the first disk 
and read another portion of that disk into memory, and on and on. 
Copying a full disk may take more than a dozen such switches and as 
long as 8 minutes. On a Lisa running MacWorks, much larger portions of the disk 
can be read into memory, significantly reducing the amount of disk switching 
and time to complete the copying. Another example of where Lisa&rsquo;s 
larger memory makes <i>MacWorks</i> superior to a real Macintosh is with 
<i>MacWrite.</i> On an ordinary Macintosh, you are limited to about a 
fifteen-page document. Under MacWorks, the limit is many times this amount.
</p><p>
<b>Speed differences.</b> Although the central processors used in Lisa and 
Macintosh &ndash; the Motorola 68000 &ndash; are identical, Macintosh&rsquo;s 
processor runs faster: 8 megahertz for the Macintosh vs. 5 megahertz for 
Lisa. So, you would expect the real Macintosh to run at least 1.6 times 
faster than a Lisa running <i>MacWorks</i> (at least 1.6 times faster, because 
emulations always run slower than whatever they&rsquo;re emulating). All this may 
be true, but I contend that what really matters is whether an ordinary 
user can detect any difference between the two machines, not whether 
something takes 30 milliseconds on Macintosh and 48 milliseconds on the 
<i>MacWorks</i> Lisa. Based on informal tests I ran involving a half-dozen 
novice users, the difference is not noticeable.
</p><p>
<b>External devices.</b> Lisa and Macintosh do not have the same external 
interfaces, so they may not be able to connect to the same sorts of devices. 
Macintosh has no parallel interface, for example, making it unable even 
to connect physically to a Profile hard disk. Even those devices which, 
in theory, may connect to both systems cannot work properly because of the 
lack of system software that enables Lisa or Macintosh to communicate with 
the external device.
</p><p>
A <i>MacWorks</i> Lisa can, however, share a Profile or the internal 10-megabyte 
Winchester with the Lisa Office System. This is done by allocating portions 
of the hard disk when the Office System is installed. During the 
installation (with the Lisa Office System I micro diskette)
you are asked to choose between various options for partitioning the disk 
between Lisa and <i>MacWorks.</i> When a portion of the hard disk is reserved 
for <i>MacWorks,</i> you can use Apple&rsquo;s HardDisk utility to prepare this 
portion of the hard disk for Macintosh files. When this is done, Lisa and 
Macintosh files can coexist on the same disk, although neither system can 
read the other&rsquo;s files. By copying the Macintosh system files to the 
hard disk, you can then operate Macintosh applications from the hard disk 
without having a Macintosh micro diskette in the disk drive. This significantly 
improves the speed of all Macintosh applications.
</p><p>
The HardDisk utility, of course, also allows you to dedicate a Profile 
or 10-megabyte Winchester to <i>MacWorks.</i> In this case, the Lisa Office 
System material is erased and all of the hard disk is used for 
Macintosh files. Currently, the HardDisk utility works correctly only for 
the hard disk connected to the internal parallel port. Future enhancements 
will allow you to use this facility on a disk accessed via a parallel interface card.
</p><p>
Similarly, Macintosh currently can connect with only one type of printer &ndash; 
the Apple Imagewriter. Lisa can connect with many other printers.
</p><p class=caption>
The bottom line
</p><p>
There are only two problems I have observed with <i>MacWorks.</i> The first is 
its less than simple installation. The second is the lack of data portability 
between Lisa and Macintosh.
</p><p>
The first problem is so obvious it is difficult to imagine that the 
same designers who produced the superb user interfaces of Lisa and Macintosh would 
subject you to the loading sequence described earlier. One simple but 
tremendous improvement would be for Lisa to indicate after <i>MacWorks</i> 
has been installed that &ldquo;The basic <i>MacWorks</i> software has 
been loaded. Insert any Macintosh software disk to complete the process,&rdquo; 
or some similar message.
</p><p>
The second problem is really a Lisa-Macintosh compatibility issue. Data 
files created by Macintosh (or by Lisa running <i>MacWorks</i>) are not 
readable by Lisa. This is an undesirable situation for two products in 
the same family of one company. At the very least, there should be 
a utility that would convert <i>MacWrite</i> documents to <i>LisaWrite</i> 
documents and <i>MacDraw</i> documents to <i>LisaDraw</i> documents, because all these are
Apple products. Obviously, the ideal would be for the formats to be almost 
identical. Perhaps this would require changing too much existing software. 
And, of course, it is desirable for Macintosh spreadsheets and business graphics 
to be readable by Lisa.
</p><p>
The bottom line is that, even with the few problems mentioned here, <i>MacWorks</i> 
is an excellent adjunct to the Lisa system. <i>MacWorks</i> brings the growing 
amount of software available for Macintosh to the Lisa user, albeit with 
a few compatibility problems. No Lisa user should be without <i>MacWorks.</i>
