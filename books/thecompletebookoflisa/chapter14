In the preceding chapters, I&rsquo;ve described the Lisa Office System in its 
form as of mid-1984. Since its original announcement in January 1983, there 
have been several versions of this software, each with significant enhancements 
and improvements. The original software, for example, was much slower, had 
no color printer output, no spelling checker in <i>LisaWrite,</i> allowed only 
twenty holidays in <i>LisaProject,</i> and permitted no rotation in <i>LisaDraw</i>
and only partial integration among the various programs. Given these and other 
improvements in less than 2 years, it is reasonable to ask where Lisa 
will be in the coming months and years.
</p><p>
Predicting the future is a risky business in any field, but it is especially risky 
in the fast-paced, high-tech world of personal computers, where a single 
month can see the introduction of several new systems and the demise of several others. 
With that disclaimer, here are several predictions for Lisa&rsquo;s future in 
many areas, including the Lisa Office System, other Lisa software, Macintosh 
compatibility, and new and expanded hardware. These predictions are based on 
my discussions with Lisa&rsquo;s software developers as well as an examination 
of the marketplace&rsquo;s ability to fill some of Lisa&rsquo;s deficiencies.
</p><p class=caption>
Lisa&rsquo;s Office System
</p><p>
One of the most recent and most important changes to the Lisa Office System 
is one you will never see directly: the ability of many new pieces of 
software &ndash; both system software (allowing Lisa to communicate with 
new output devices) and applications software (providing you with new desktop 
functions) &ndash; to be added to Lisa incrementally. This is vital to 
Lisa&rsquo;s future because it separates the release of new hardware and 
software from the release of the entire Lisa operating system. This means that 
Apple can make small but important software
additions and modifications without reissuing the entire <i>Desktop Manager.</i> 
Moreover, that new hardware can be packaged with the appropriate pieces of 
software, allowing Lisa to communicate with that hardware. In addition, 
this change also provides the basis by which new functions can be added 
to Lisa&rsquo;s desktop, giving independent software developers the environment upon 
which to add new applications software &ndash; which, in turn, increases 
the usefulness of Lisa.
</p><p>
This change also means that there is less need to modify the basic 
Lisa software, making this software relatively stable. The extendability and 
flexibility built into this release make another major release unlikely. 
Moreover, once large numbers of independent software vendors are using 
an operating system, both users and developers find it very tramautic to make changes.
</p><p>
To a large extent, the same probably is true for many Lisa programs. They, 
too, are very close to their final form, for two reasons. First, 
Apple appears to be adopting the philosophy that it has provided the 
most basic Lisa software and that most additional Lisa software will come from 
independent software developers. Second, Apple is concentrating its software 
staff on the Macintosh, even to the extent of reducing its efforts with 
Lisa. So, it woulld be surprising if a future version of <i>LisaWrite</i> provided 
grammar checking and an analysis of comprehensibility, for example. It would 
be less surprising if an independent software company created a &ldquo;writer&rsquo;s 
workbench&rdquo; set of programs as a separate iconic function on the 
Lisa desktop &ndash; completely separate from <i>LisaWrite.</i>
</p><p>
The single exception to these two predictions for the <i>Office System</i> 
may be the release of a set of programs that will run on a Lisa 
with only 512K bytes of memory. This would benefit every Lisa user. For 
those with existing 1,024K-byte systems, such a release would mean a 
faster operating system and probably faster programs of greater 
capacity &ndash; for example, larger spreadsheets in <i>LisaCalc.</i> For 
potential Lisa purchasers, the cost of the additional 512K bytes would be 
an option, rather than the mandatory component it currently is.
</p><p class=caption>
New software
</p><p>
The future for new Lisa software looks extremely promising. Before we take 
a look at those programs, however, it&rsquo;s important to differentiate
between the two ways in which software can run on Lisa. Software can be written 
to take over Lisa, in a manner similar to the <i>MacWorks</i> operation. Such 
software cannot be used in conjunction with the Lisa Office System and 
probably cannot exchange data with programs such as <i>LisaWrite</i> and 
<i>LisaList.</i> To use this type of software, you must, in effect, &ldquo;turn 
off&rdquo; the Office System. Such software uses Lisa as an extremely 
powerful personal computer with a high-resolution graphics screen and a 
mouse. It does not, however, make use of the revolutionary software base 
upon which Lisa technology is centered.
</p><p>
The other way software can be run on Lisa is as a new type of icon 
on Lisa&rsquo;s desktop. This type of software runs in conjunction with 
the Office System and usually can exchange data with the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; 
Lisa programs as well as with other new icons from independent software 
developers. This software also possess the uniformity of the Lisa user 
interface. It makes extensive use of menus, the mouse, Dialog Boxes, 
the clipboard, and stationery pads.
</p><p>
Software can be added to Lisa via three programming environments, two of which 
can lead to programs that you see as new icons on the Lisa desktop. These 
three environments are the <i>Lisa Workshop, Quickport,</i> and the <i>Lisa Toolkit.</i>
</p><p>

One future Lisa software package is <i>LisaPaint,</i> which allows you to prepare such images.

The <i>Lisa Workshop</i> is a program-development environment that enables a software 
developer to prepare Pascal, C, COBOL, or BASIC programs for Lisa. This development 
system provides an environment that is as powerful as those provided on any 
mainframe computer. Pascal is the language of choice for these programs because 
it provides a programmer with the most powerful set of utilities, including 
graphics and mouse control.
</p><p>
<i>Quickport</i> is another path for the independent Lisa software developer. 
<i>Quickport</i> enables a developer to integrate any existing Pascal, C, 
COBOL, or BASIC program into the Lisa desktop with a limited set of menu 
choices and very basic data integration with standard Lisa programs. With 
this development path, a software developer can provide you with a window 
on the Lisa screen that has a text portion and even a graphics portion. 
Moreover, the standard cutting and pasting operation will work as it does in 
the full Lisa programs. This probably is the best path for moving an 
existing program to the Lisa desktop quickly.

The <i>Lisa Toolkit</i> is the premier development path for new Lisa software. 
It provides an independent software developer with the
ability to custom-fit an application into the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; Lisa user 
interface, custom menus and Dialog Boxes can be defined, as can window 
components, such as the <i>LisaDraw</i> Palette and the <i>LisaCalc</i> status-panel 
area. When Apple designed Lisa&rsquo;s line of seven standard programs, it 
did more than simply prepare these applications. It also designed a <i>Toolkit</i>
that represents the combined wisdom and experience gained along the way. The <i>Toolkit</i> 
brings to a developer the full power and integration of the Lisa system 
and user interface.
</p><p>
There is a price to pay for this power, however. As might be expected from 
the revolutionary nature of Lisa&rsquo;s application programs, the design 
of programs that use the <i>Toolkit</i> must be done in a revolutionary 
manner. Just as Apple used much of the knowledge gained from research efforts 
at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the design of Lisa&rsquo;s user 
interface, it also used much of the knowledge gained at Xerox PARC in the 
design of the programming languages and programming style used to create Lisa 
itself. The language Apple designed for this task is called &ldquo;Clascal.&rdquo; 
Although it is derived from Pascal, it is quite unlike the standard 
language with which most programmers are familar.
</p><p>
Clascal and the <i>Toolkit</i> are powerful programs that can provide a developer 
with the abililty to design and implement highly complex programs quickly and 
easily &ndash; if a developer is willing to take the time to learn to 
use these programming aids. Most innovative developers are willing to take such a step.
</p><p>
Many software developers have released products for Lisa, and many more are 
now developing such products. These products span a wide range of applications. 
Some products on the way will probably have wide appeal among Lisa users. For example:

Greater compatibility between between Lisa and Macintosh definitely
will be achieved in coming months. At a minimum, this will take the form of 
a <i>Quickport</i> program that will convert Macintosh documents on diskettes 
to programs on Lisa&rsquo;s desktop: <i>MacWrite</i> documents to <i>LisaWrite, 
MapDraw</i> documents to <i>LisaDraw,</i> and, assuming the existence of 
<i>LisaPaint, MacPaint</i> documents to <i>LisaPaint.</i> Conversions in the other 
direction also may be possible, subject to Macintosh&rsquo;s size and diskette 
constraints. (A <i>MacPaint</i> document is limited to a single 
8-&frac12;&rdquo;&times;11&rdquo; document, whereas <i>LisaPaint</i> probably will 
have the same 48&rdquo;&times;96&rdquo; limitation permitted in <i>LisaDraw</i> 
and <i>LisaProject. MacWrite</i> documents are limited to fewer than twenty 
pages, whereas <i>LisaWrite</i> documents can be several hundred pages. Also, without 
a hard disk, such a Lisa-to-Macintosh conversion will probably require many 
disk switches.) To make such conversions easy, the set of fonts on both 
Lisa and Macintosh (or at least on Lisa) probably will become the union of 
fonts available on each. (The two systems use several different typefaces.)
</p><p>
Most desirable would be complete compatibility without requiring any type of file 
format conversion. This may be too much to hope for.
</p><p class=caption>
New hardware
</p><p>
After having undergone a hardware change in early 1984, Lisa&rsquo;s hardware 
is probably now stable. (Before January 1984, Lisa had two high-capacity diskette 
drives and a different face plate. The hardware upgrade converted to 
the single diskette for future Macintosh compatibility and to make room for 
the 10-megabyte internal hard disk. This upgrade was provided free to all owners 
of the earlier Lisa models.) An upgrade of the diskette drive is expected from 
a single-sided, 400K-per-diskette drive to a double-sided, 800K-per-diskette 
drive. This micro diskette drive upgrade probably won&rsquo;t be provided for free.
</p><p>
Additional hardware that probably will become available includes a separately 
mounted diskette drive, and several networking options, including a connection 
to the Ethernet local area network system and to AppleBus, Apple&rsquo;s 
local area network.
</p><p class=caption>
AppleBus
</p><p>
AppleBus is Apple&rsquo;s peripheral bus that can be used to connect a
maximum thirty-two devices in an area about 1,000 feet in diameter. Logically, 
AppleBus is a single wire to which Lisas, Macintoshes, and several other devices 
can connect. Any device on this wire can transmit material to any other device 
at a speed of approximately 230,000 bits per second. (Compare this to the 
maximum speed of both <i>LisaTerminal</i> and <i>MacTerminal,</i> about 19,000 
bits per second; AppleBus is about ten times faster.)
</p><p>
Most other devices that will connect to AppleBus are considered to be 
&ldquo;servers,&rdquo; userless computers that exist strictly to perform 
functions for network users. Servers come in a variety of forms, including file 
servers, print servers, and communication servers.

in two varieties: bridges and gateways. A bridge connects one AppleBus to 
another. Bridges don&rsquo;t modify the data transmitted; they provide a 
method of overcoming the 1,000-foot AppleBus distance limitation, albeit at 
a lower speed. Bridges can use telephone lines to connect to distant networks, 
for example, even transcontinentally. Gateways connect AppleBus to other 
types of networks. They often must translate data formats (called &ldquo;protocols&rdquo;) 
to those used on the other networks. This translation can be very easy 
if the networks are similar, or very difficult if they are not.

AppleBus is a cable constructed of two wires twisted together plus the connection 
hardware to connect the network components to that cable, enabling higher data 
speeds with greater reliability. The interconnection hardware consists of a 
plug that connects to one of Lisa&rsquo;s external ports, a &ldquo;tap&rdquo; 
into the network cable, and a &ldquo;drop cable&rdquo; between these two 
connection devices. This type of network architecture both isolates the 
network from any problems on a single network node (a &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; run 
amok!) and gives you maximum flexibility for moving network components easily 
and quickly from place to place.
